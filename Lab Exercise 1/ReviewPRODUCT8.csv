"2","Johnny Lin","Reviewed in Australia on 29 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Am very sad at having to return this for a refund.  Prior to purchase, the indication I had from initial internet research was that Tidal Music was supported.  However, on receiving the Echo and setting it up, I found that Tidal Music is NOT supported.  More detailed internet research on the issue confirmed that.Misled, I think, by how skewed internet results are towards the US market, such that I initially didn't spot the relatively few references to lack of support in Australia.I really don't understand why though?  I'm a long time subscriber to Tidal Music via my phone / iPad / PC, and Tidal is very straightforwardly made available direct to the Australian consumer.Anyway, what value to the Echo if one can't listen to the music one is paying for?  "
"3","Johnny Lin","Reviewed in Australia on 29 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        I used Google Nest Minis for months to years before deciding to switch to Amazon Echoes. I gave it a few months with the Echoes which seem more customisable than the Google ones which is nice, but the Echoes really started to show their cracks. The number one issue is I often have to repeat my command because it doesn't pick up that I'm saying ""Alexa"". I originally used ""Computer"" which had the same problem - the mic is just not as sensitive as the Nest Minis, and it seems to want me to pause after saying ""Alexa"". You can say ""Alexa, turn the lights on"" but not ""Alexa turn the lights on"" (note the comma).Another issue (that I could potentially overlook if the wake word worked) was that I can't use ""Alexa, turn the light on for 5 minutes"" unless I specifically make a routine (ie. a set of actions) that works to do this, and the Nest Minis did this naturally without any preparation. Worse, you have to do for each increment of time that you plan to use in future - if you create a routine for 5 minutes, you need a separate routine for 10 minutes, etc. I put up with this for months and eventually gave up on it about a week ago.The sound from the echo is really good, and the sound from the echo dot is very below average. If I was going to stick with the echoes, I'd buy an echo for each room, maybe even if I didn't plan to play music from it. If I really didn't care, the echo dot's sound would be fine really, but the comparison between the two is a huge difference. It's like comparing telephone/radio quality to CD quality.  "
"4","JW","Reviewed in Australia on 10 May 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        Hrmmm. These have been a disappointment‚Ä¶ I previously had the cylinder shaped echos working in a stereo pair with sub‚Ä¶ these have honestly been a downgrade in reliability - audio quality doesn‚Äôt seem any better either. Let me share my experience. Using these as a stereo pair plus sub.BUGS. BUGS BUGS!!!Triggering Alexa has become MUCH harder.Music just stops playing randomly all the time.Music drops out and you only hear the base track on one of the speakers.Can‚Äôt play radio anymore, just stops after 1-5 mins.The fabric on-top is a PITA - easy to get dirty if you manually adjust volume in the kitchen... Speaking of, if you press volume up more then 5 times in a row. The speaker pair crashes, music stops.The led ring being on the bottom is a PITA. With the old echos you could easily see that she was listening and the LEDs were on top.With these, the LED listening ring is hard to see behind other small items on the table. Sometimes you speak out an entire command to reaslise she‚Äôs not listening.All in all. For whatever reason. My old echos were 98% reliable. These new ones were purchased at full price and have been a severe disappointment. I‚Äôm hoping the bugs get ironed out ASAP, as my smart home relies heavily on my Alexa devices performing as expected.Don‚Äôt buy unless on special. Helps make the sting hurt less when they wig out all the time.  "
"5","Avatar","Reviewed in Australia on 6 January 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        its loud, its constant and it drives you mad.If only there was a way to disable it. Communications settings for device greyed out.It's a known 'feature' that Amazon wont fix.  "
"6","Ian","Reviewed in Australia on 27 June 2022","2.0 out of 5 stars","        mic just stopped working after 18 months bit disappointing and not covered under warranty. The mic needed to be more powerful in any case  "
"7","Fibbs","Reviewed in Australia on 31 December 2023","2.0 out of 5 stars","        No only does Alexia talk too much, I have to upgrade to premium Amazon music because it won't work with Tidal or YouTube music. It won't play anything you ask for music wise unless you have the premium package even though I have Amazon Prime. I have a xiaomi speaker that is way easier to use and talks less!  "
"8","Nick","Reviewed in Australia on 13 July 2022","1.0 out of 5 stars","        I'm really disappointed with the new Echo. While the so-called premium sound really doesn't sound much better than my prior Echo, that hasn't turned into as much of a disappointment as the microphone. I sit four or five feet away from it and it only wakes to my voice perhaps 60% of the time. In fact, the echo I have in the next room and down the hall wakes nearly 100% of the time and responds while the new one does nothing. It is incredibly frustrating! With the new echo, it doesn't matter if I'm right next to it, raising my voice over the top of it, shouting at it, or repeating Alexa 20 times in different ways or volume levels! It's hard to express how bad it is!  "
"9","Sasi111","Reviewed in Australia on 25 April 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        I was disappointed to learn from the Amazon support centre I could only connect one Speaker to my  Samsung QLED Smart TV. This was despite the fact there‚Äôs a video on You Tube showing that it is possible.  "
"10","GayleH","Reviewed in Australia on 19 November 2020","1.0 out of 5 stars","        I had really high hopes for this but it rarely responds to my voice and sound quality is poor to fair. Not sure why Amazon would release this when it's an inferior product. Our Echo Dots work great, I was after something for a bigger room but there's really no need, and I certainly wouldn't recommend this. It's basically a very pretty round ball with blue lights, it's that's what you're after then this is for you!!! If you want a good speaker, buy something else. If you want a good unit to run Alexa, stick with the Dot. Honestly, don't buy this. It is just plain useless and won't pick up your voice.  "

"13","FireOneNineYT ","Reviewed in Australia on 18 November 2023","4.6 out of 5 stars","        I ordered this Echo Gen 4 last night, Black Friday sale price $72 AU- down from $169. Received it a few hrs ago. Plugged it in. Downloaded the Alexa app', and away we go. I bought it to replace a battery Ryobi speaker in bathroom. This Echo has great immersive sound, rich & full bass. More than loud enough for the bathroom. I immediately went & plugged it into the tv. Two of these Echos would be great tv speakers. I'm all sorted for tv speakers for all 3 tv setups, with Denon, Meredo, & Technics sound bars & speakers. But a twin setup of these Echos would give any of my other setups a run for their money at half the price & twice the functionality. Interested in how much better the Gen 5's are. A very happy customer. Thanks Amazon üëçEdit- it's been a week & I'm even more impressed with this speaker. This Echo 4th gen punches WAAAY above its weight. Alexia AI is very good. Very intuitive. Hasn't missed a beat. I'm very very impressed. I'll be replacing my bedroom $400 soundbar with two more of these Echo 4th or 5th Gen's synced & linked together. The sound is spot on- beautifully balanced. The bass is rich & punchy. Haven't needed past level 7 volume- mostly 4-6. Can't recommend this product enough üëç  "
"14","Johnny Lin","Reviewed in Australia on 29 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Awesome fast service, the device is great to use, had a few little issues connecting to wi-fi (was a little slow) but got there in the end. Speaker quality is good, but not great, would have preferred something with a little move oomph. But can't complain it does the job and is a great new addition to the house. Can set alarms with ease when cooking, appointment reminders, etc. I listen to my Spotify and favorite local radio station with ease, can even increase and decrease volume with word commands, even mute it if you need to make a call. I haven't explored everything this little lady can do, nor adapted it for other smart function such as lights, TV and other smart devices. Small steps LOL  "
"15","FireOneNineYT ","Reviewed in Australia on 18 November 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        Echo meets all my needs. It would be better if there was an equaliser function available as the base response is not what I like.  "
"16","Scott","Reviewed in Australia on 21 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Great device  "
"17","Richard W.","Reviewed in Australia on 4 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Writing this review as a first time smart-speaker owner, I don't have any real comparison to similar products.Setup was a breeze. Under 5 minutes from opening the box I had it fully working with my voice. No unnecessary packaging or complicated guides, just a 1 page quick-start.Sound quality is good. It isn't something that I was blown away by, but the music I listen to stays clear enough in my medium sized room even at the loudest volume.Construction feels solid. I'm fairly sure the courier threw it over my fence and the product sustained no damage. The blue colour is fairly subtle and goes with most of my furniture, happy with this decision over the more bland white/ black options.The virtual assistant (Alexa/ Echo) works well and for me was very intuitive. The app is able to teach you any voice commands if you are wondering how to set up a very specific thing, but I've found my first guess almost always works. It was also able to respond to French commands as well as English without any additional setup.Used this speaker predominately to play music/ set timers while I'm cooking, or to get a news/ weather update while I'm running around doing my morning routine. Very convenient being able to set these things up when your hands are busy.Overall very happy with my purchase.  "
"18","Lesley","Reviewed in Australia on 23 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","        If you're planing to 'alexa' your home, spend the extra money and get the premium sound version. No, it wont be as good as a multi room Bose system, but it wont put the same massive dent in your bank account either. Really good sound for the average listener that only requires a power point to work. My tip is put two of these in each room to get a truly dynamic sound at an affordable price, along with all the other features such as news and weather they provide. Also integrated really well with Ring doorbells and smart plugs.  "
"19","Korellai","Reviewed in Australia on 16 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I‚Äôve recently been getting into audio books and wanted something I could easily listen to them with when I‚Äôm in bed. After a little research I decided the new Echo was going to best for my needs, especially with the deal Amazon had running at the time - almost half price for the premium sound option!Being a bit of an audiophile / snob, some of the reviews did make me a little anxious that it wouldn‚Äôt live up to expectations - how wrong they were. I‚Äôm not sure if these reviewers got a device from a ‚Äòbad batch‚Äô, but the audio quality is actually amazing, from a device so small and with such an interesting design. I‚Äôm extremely impressed. The microphone has never missed a beat either, I‚Äôve not had to repeat myself once. Maybe software has improved the reliability of this since the other reviewers posted about theirs not always working? Not sure. But mine is perfectly fine.As for Alexa in general, I can‚Äôt get over how good it is. It understands my commands straight away and does what I ask almost instantly. Want to listen to a UK radio station? Just say ‚ÄòAlexa, play BBC radio 1‚Äô. Less than a second later, it‚Äôs on. Want to know how to say something in Chinese? Just ask. She‚Äôll tell you, then go straight back to what was playing.I know I‚Äôm only just scratching the surface with what Alexa can do but coming from someone who‚Äôs resisted voice control for a number of years either due to its reputation of being ‚Äònot good enough yet‚Äô or just feeling gimmicky, I‚Äôm glad I finally pulled the trigger. This Echo is easily my new favourite thing. And for only 80 bucks, it‚Äôs an absolute steal for the sound quality and ease of use.  "
"20","Stuart Burney","Reviewed in Australia on 29 December 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","        For context: I own the echo dot 3rd gen, echo dot 4th gen, Echo plus 2nd gen and now the Echo 4th gen.Let's get right to why this isn't a five star review. The microphones. Amazon actually took a step backwards and went with a 4 microphone array that is inferior to the Echo plus 2nd gen (and echo 3rd gen), which have a seven microphone array. This is the only downfall of this speaker.I'm not a big fan of the spherical design either but that's a subjective opinion. What that translates to in the real world is a voice pickup that is good but not great. This was a major disappointment for me since I use my Echo speakers to control all smart home devices (~30 devices) and mic pickup is crucial for that.As for what this speaker does right:-Better sound quality with a bigger emphasis on mid range. It won't blow you away. It's still V shaped and punchy but it's good. The treble was a little spikey for me but it's a step in the right direction regardless-Faster processor. Everything it does it just a little bit more snappy than the other models-Support for Matter. It's not released yet but this will make a huge difference in the future-The power adaptor is slimmer and no longer blocks the neighbouring power socket. FINALLY.-Zigbee support. My Echo plus 2nd gen has this and little door sensors have changed my smart home gameWhat could use some improvement:-Apparently this speaker has an ultrasound sensor. Apparently it's about as useful as if it didn't. Tried it on this speaker and the 4th gen echo dot for triggering smart home routines and it did absolutely nothing. Who knows, updates might fix this-the sphere can hide that light ring at the bottom sometimes so you don't know if Alexa heard you or is just giving you attitude-the black speaker now comes with a white adaptor? WHYY-this has a new low power mode. And this supposed low power mode doesn't work if you have Spotify linked to your echo speaker. Are you okay Amazon? Spotify is the most used music streaming serviceTLDR: this speaker is a compelling product in the echo line-up and has so much more potential. It has a few shortcomings and a couple of hiccups but it's a solid pick. I'd hesitate to pay full price but it's a strong contender on sale.  "
