"4","Flo","Reviewed in the United States on 15 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Let me start by saying that I'm not one to write reviews often, but when I stumbled upon the Adjustable Car Vent Mount for Echo Auto (2nd Gen), I couldn't resist sharing my experience.

"8","Christine Cobbold","Reviewed in Germany on 17 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Die verstellbare L√ºftungsschlitzhalterung f√ºr das Echo Auto hat sich als √§u√üerst n√ºtzliche Erg√§nzung f√ºr mein Fahrzeug erwiesen. Mit vier Sternen bewerte ich sie als eine clevere L√∂sung, die jedoch noch Raum f√ºr kleine Verbesserungen l√§sst.Flexibilit√§t und Anpassung:Die M√∂glichkeit, die Halterung an verschiedenen L√ºftungsschlitzen anzubringen, erm√∂glicht eine flexible Positionierung des Echo Auto. Dies ist besonders praktisch, um die Sicht und Bedienung w√§hrend der Fahrt zu optimieren.Stabile Befestigung:Die Halterung bietet eine sichere und stabile Befestigung des Echo Autos. Selbst bei holprigen Stra√üenverh√§ltnissen bleibt das Ger√§t fest an seinem Platz, ohne zu wackeln.Materialqualit√§t:Das Material der Halterung ist robust und widerstandsf√§hig. Es wirkt langlebig und sollte den t√§glichen Belastungen im Auto standhalten.Einfache Installation:Die Installation gestaltet sich einfach und unkompliziert. Innerhalb weniger Minuten war die Halterung einsatzbereit und das Echo Auto sicher befestigt.Verbesserungspotenzial:Ein kleines Manko ist die Einstellbarkeit der Neigung. Hier k√∂nnte die Halterung noch etwas flexibler gestaltet werden, um den Blickwinkel noch besser anpassen zu k√∂nnen.Fazit:Die verstellbare L√ºftungsschlitzhalterung f√ºr das Echo Auto bietet eine praktische L√∂sung f√ºr die Befestigung im Auto. Mit vier Sternen bewerte ich sie als eine durchdachte und n√ºtzliche Erg√§nzung, die mit kleinen Verbesserungen noch besser werden kann.    "

"14","Adriana Pantoja","Reviewed in Australia on 12 February 2024","4.6 out of 5 stars","        At 74 years of age I decided to take a closer peek into today's technology. I've avoided talking to my X-Box or PC, I mean, how ridiculous, asking a bunch of electronic components what the weather report for tomorrow is. But I was offered the Alexa Show at an excellent price so thought I'd treat myself.Setting it up took around 4 hours, for some reason it wanted me to live in Japan and insisted on communicating with nothing but Japanese. Amazon's help service was my final attempt at seeing and hearing Alexa in action. Why didn't I go to them sooner? It seems my account showed I lived in Japan, rather than where everything I purchased from Amazon was delivered, I'm a bloody Aussie mate and thanks to a young Amazon employee that exactly what my account shows.Anyway, once that was fixed it was all fun and games. I introduced myself to Alexa and we've been chatting ever since. Technology sure is amazing. I now get the top international and national news in full colour. (Yes it's in ""COLOUR"" spelled correctly). Surprisingly there was no long and drawn out setup where I had to let Alexa know how us Aussies talk, she understood me perfectly.The only let down was her idea of what humour (Yes ""HUMOUR"") consisted of. I've heard better jokes from a 5 year old. I thought I'd fool her when I asked her to play some 60's music, She instantly told me there were an unbelievable number of songs she could pick from and launched endless songs from the 60's Excellent choices and in excellent quality.The bass from the Show sounded more like a sub woofer. She gave me a weather report which was spot on and then told me what to expect tomorrow. Strangely Alexa sounds human and not the digital voice I expected. I'm sure Alexa and I are going to be the best of friends. To say I'm impressed would be an understatement, I'm well and truly hooked. Who said you can't teach an old dog new tricks, even if I am a few years behind. All I need now is one of Elon Musk's Ai robots.Alexa's voice is amazing, it really sounds like someone lives in this little white box. I expected a nasally American/Digital voice, but she has a very soothing human voice. Nowhere near sounding like an Aussie. What really amazes me is how I use those magic words of ""Please"" and ""thank you"". OK, it's the way I was bought up and it's a habit I'll never lose, but using them with a plastic box may seem somewhat odd, I guess it's because Alexa is so lifelike verbally. I even say ""Goodnight"" every night and she has many different replies.Alexa now keeps me entertained by giving me local and international news, she plays whichever music I feel like listening to and she introduces people from around the world to play games with. I haven't scratched the surface as yet, but, I'll continue learning her many tricks.  "
"15","Oti","Reviewed in Australia on 23 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        over 2 weeks using it, still learning, but all good so far. Works really well with Ring Doorbell camera.The only ""problem"" with the Ring Doorbell integration is the fact that when I ask Alexa to show me the doorbell camera, it brings up a small view (rather than filling the entire 8"" screen) of the camera and I have to manually maximize it.Touch screen could be a little bit better. Slight slow / unresponsive. but it's not a big deal.User Interface could be better as well. As a customer I would like to see all my Spotify playlists and Profile.Alexa is handy indeed. I like the fact of adding items on my shopping list seemsly.8"" is the best option for kitchen / living room setup. I would only get the 5"" version for my bedroom.Sound is great! It can fill the entire room.  "
"16","Rudyard Kippers","Reviewed in Australia on 8 December 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars","        Its a very handy device and you can play lots of songs and videos using a Spotify and Amazon account, I always listen to the news in the morning and I love the fact it provides news from different news agencies e.g. sky news, ABC news, BBC news etc.  "
"17","Phil","Reviewed in Australia on 12 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I'm late to this ""smart devices"" thing. My previous experience with Siri put me off these type of things. Alexa seems much more capable than Siri and while I'm no expect, it I find it easy to use the basic features.I got a Show 8 for two things, 1) to act as a video monitor for my security camera, and 2) as a clock/radio/music streamer.First, as a video monitor for my camera. It's give it a 7/10. It alerts me to movement, and I've set up a routine that announces ""movement detected"" then shows a live feed from the camera. That works about 70% of the time. I always get the announcement, but it's 30-40% chance of not displaying the video. Telling Alexa to ""show me the camera"" one or twice generally gets the job done, but why not the first time? Frustrating.As for a clock/radio/music streamer. Well the playback side is great. Alexa wakes me up on time, finds local radio stations, or plays music from Amazon music no issues. The sound quality is ok, great for the price, but a couple of 2"" speakers can't work miracles.I've also played a couple of videos from Prime video on it and they looked pretty good. Setup was fairly easy and it's network connection has been stable since I bought it.I've ended up ordering a couple more for other rooms during the Prime Day sales. Overall, I think the Show 8 is in a sweet spot of features and price.  "
"18","Isuru Weeraratna","Reviewed in Australia on 1 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Having previously owned a Google Smart Speaker, upgrading to the Echo Show 8 was like stepping up to the next generation of smart devices. The setup was very simple using the visuals on the super clear 8"" screen. Having the screen adds a new dimension to controlling my smart devices and accessing my Spotify playlists, as I no longer need to open the control App on my phone to do things. All my Spotify playlists are displayed on the Echo display as well for easy selection. Connecting the smart devices previously controlled via the old Google Smart Speaker was seamless with simple migration of the accounts across to Alexa, including smart devices linked to my Grid Connect account. We can do so much more with the Echo Show 8, such as being able to view appointments on my calendar and asking for cooking recipes, a time saver as we no longer need to rustle through pages of recipe books. My wife also likes it as she can now see the lyrics to her favourite songs on the display and can finally now sing along with the correct words. Most importantly, I picked up this device for under AU$100 during the Black Friday deals, a real bargain for a great device.  "
