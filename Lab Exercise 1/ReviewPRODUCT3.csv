"4","Doug Steele","Reviewed in Australia on 5 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        It works, but is a clunky product that adds to the cable mess. I'd much rather a fire stick model with integrated Ethernet port, even if it cost the same as these two (stick+adapter) combined. Laptop USB to Ethernet adapter is tiny, why does this need to be large with an extra short cable?Works so 4 stars.  "
"5","Very good ","Reviewed in Australia on 29 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Works perfectly with my wired Ethernet, great price, quick post, highly recommended, much quick than Wifi connection.  "
"6","Matthew","Reviewed in Australia on 31 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Saves plugging in power point no need for cables very good thanks  "

"9","Denny","Reviewed in Australia on 19 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I have 1000mbps down and this limits my Firestick to about 90 mbps. I get about 150mbps using wifi6 (because vpn) and after extensive testing, Wifi is faster and i ended up removing it. However, it does work. Just not what I needed.  "
"10","Paul hammat","Reviewed in Australia on 20 November 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Needs a 5 year warranty, didn't last as long as my firetv... is just a generic cat5 to usb connector...wont be getting another, wifi is decent at our house so we have no issue with that so this is waste of money and fails after only two years.
