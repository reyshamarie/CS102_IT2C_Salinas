"3","Andre Louhanapessy","Reviewed in Australia on 20 February 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars","        It's actually quite a fast little device that made my old smart tv useable again.You can use a VPN and sideloading to install streaming apps from other countries... It works with Kodi too which is great for local streaming.It can also take over your TVs remote so you don't need to use two remotes.Great little device.  "

"6","Llewellyn Biggar","Reviewed in Australia on 26 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        This has made the not smart TV work just as well as the smart TV. Hasn’t been used a lot since it was installed yet.  "
"7","Steven E.","Reviewed in Australia on 8 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I feel compelled to write this review for those who haven’t tried it. I bought it on Prime day for $99 to replace my Samsung S9 o/s. Post the proliferation of streaming services I have found hunting for something to watch increasingly more challenging, and this device helps with that. The o/s is very intuitive, fast and makes switching between channels/streaming services easy. It’s a huge upgrade to the OEM o/s. Couldn’t recommend it more highly.  "
"8","Pippa","Reviewed in Australia on 7 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Fire TV is great, the main reason is the steamlined interface, but the Android support is a must. This led me to buy more echo devices to create an Amazon Home Theatre setup, and not my home entertainment setup looks and sounds great.  "
"9","Chameleon","Reviewed in Australia on 27 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I purchased as an upgrade from my Firestick max 2022. Better specs that the Firestick max 2023Onboard usb and Ethernet ports.I’m very happy with the cube and happy to recommendAAA+++  "
"10","Chameleon","Reviewed in Australia on 26 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        When I first got the cube I couldn't sync the sound no matter what, got the cube back out of the cupboard to try again, very happy I did sound was perfect thru Atmos soundbar, great picture well worth it. Seems all initial bugs have been sorted thru updates. I can finally recommend the cube to anyone who is thinking of getting one.  "

"13","Abul Quamer","Reviewed in Australia on 9 December 2023","4.4 out of 5 stars","        I am a nvidia shield tv pro user. So coming from 2 full sized usb 3 ports, 3gb ram & a machine that supports AI upscaling software trickery. So Am I missing all that ? For some reason no, not that much. The fire tv cube is newer hardware and feels powerful. It outputs a distinct and crisp colour tone which I can’t explain but feels nicer and perfect to the eye on an oled screen. It doesn’t have an aggressive AI upscaling tech on <4k videos like the shield tv pro but feels as if it has some form of processing that makes the image smooth , sharp enough and pleasing to the eye. The interface is easy to use, I don’t miss Google tv and I have a handful of apps that I use that run perfectly for my streaming needs. The software is fast ,the remote is tactile and overall performance is responsive and zippy. The usb port can read from fat 32 or ntfs file format and I had no issues playing back large 4K video files. I don’t miss usb 3.0 this with usb 2.0 just works fine. The build quality of the cube is impressive and it’s fine little tech. What’s more impressive is that streaming wise supports hdr and Dolby vision in more apps that’s matters for example YouTube. The shield tv pro cannot playback in hdr on YouTube it’s just displays in sdr. Nvidia has done nothing in years to update the the shield tv pro. The firecube can play YouTube in HDR when available and the result is so impressive. The firetv has made my viewing experience perfect on my Oled display. Now what’s even more impressive is echo dot or Alexa built in!! Just wow I love it and this device has finally made my home smarter. I control lights in all my rooms via voice. All these features had made me forget Nvidia shield tv pro. So do I miss anything about the shield tv pro? May the AI upscaling a tiny little bit but not that much. I am absolutely loving the firetv cube, it’s a no fuss device that elevates your entertainment setup and is actually really useful. I highly recommend the firecube tv. And by the way I am all this happier because I got this on 50% sale deal that’s what makes it a sweet purchase yep, paid like $98 AUD or ~$64usd. What a steal !! What a bargain. Love it. Oh forgot to say firetv also has hdmi in port as well!! So good.  "

"15","Abul Quamer","Reviewed in Australia on 9 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        Turned my somewhat smart tv into a snappy and better looking full smart tv experience. Plus one remote does it all. I dont use the voice features. Recommended.  "
"16","Abul Quamer","Reviewed in Australia on 9 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Power and flexibility. I should have looked into years ago! Recommend  "
"17","Cheryl Parish ray parish","Reviewed in Australia on 3 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Very pleased how this unify all the streaming apps and so easy to use. The microphone remote control is fun to use.  "
"18","Bread","Reviewed in Australia on 30 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        The only thing it doesn’t have is FTA TV.It does all streaming with aplomb.It is FAST.If you voice search a movie or tv show and its available on multiple streaming channels it tells you and lets you choose.  "
"19","MDavis","Reviewed in Australia on 18 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I purchased this on special to suplement my Google TV . I finnd this not as easy to use as my google to because the home screen layout is overly cluttered for me. It definitely has all the whistles and bells one could want but I haven't found a way to declutter yet.  In time I will work it out until then I will persevere.  "
"20","Andrea G","Reviewed in Australia on 8 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Fast, flexible and does everything i need.  Very happy with product  "
"21","Andrew Morrison","Reviewed in Australia on 5 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Really fast. Faster than the latest Apple TV. Much better remote than older FireTV Stick because of the Apps button and a much, much better remote than the Apple TV. Quicker to access things and much easier to use than the Apple TV remote. The Apple TV still has a better interface and is more useful for screen mirroring from an iPhone. Forget about the Google TV 4K it is painfully slow especially when using earbuds or headphones. The lag is noticeable so voices and lips do not sync. No trouble with this on any Fire TV Stick 4K, 4K Max or Cube.  "
