"14","Kyle T. Prahl","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023","4.1 out of 5 stars","        I'm a controllerhead, always trying new PC gamepads in pursuit of the perfect one. For me, that means lots of extra inputs, the ability to map those inputs to keyboard keys, build quality, and as many premium features as possible.The bottom line: Vader 3 Pro is the closest to perfection I've yet used, and has become my new daily controller in a den filled with cast-offs.Here's what I love in the Vader 3 Pro:+ It's exceptionally comfortable to hold. It feels closer to the original XB1 controllers, which is the ideal form, rather than the slightly smaller Series X/S controllers.+ The mechanical face buttons feel amazing. Highly responsive mouse clicks, with a bit of a membrane cushion. They feel very similar to Razer's mechamembrane buttons on their Wolverine line, which is a win.+ The D-Pad is PHENOMENAL. While it looks like the Series X D-Pad in pictures, it sits above the shell a little higher and requires much less actuation force to use. When combined with highly satisfying clicks in all 8 directions, it's a masterpiece. Probably the best D-Pad I've ever used.+ The Hall Effect analog sticks are insanely accurate and completely free of stick drift. When using Gamepad Tester to check for deviation, all four axes sit at 0.00002, and they return to that value every time. I'm assuming this is the theoretical minimum. They feel incredibly pleasant to use and glide effortlessly around the anti-friction rings.+ The triggers are the best on the market. They can switch between full pulls and mechanical switches—the triggers actually convert into instant mouse clicks. This is exceedingly rare to have a controller that does both. I'm only aware of one other, from SCUF.+ It connects effortlessly to its included wireless dongle with a simple tap of the home button.+ The two extra face buttons provide additional utility, and you never feel them if you're not trying to use them. In FFXIV, I can do cheeky things like map these to my inventory or dungeon finder, minimizing the amount I need to reach for my keyboard.+ Quality control seems great. After countless returns of Elite Series 2s that were all busted in some way out of the box, it's so refreshing to unbox something that works flawlessly+ Gyro! I'm not a gyro user myself, but I can't believe how feature-rich this controller is.But no controller I've yet tried is perfect, and the Vader 3 Pro is no exception. Here's what I don't love:- The four back buttons are merely OK. They're not aligned in a way that would allow pressing two buttons on the same side at once. This is a very minor complaint, though, and I typically just use back buttons for L3 and R3 to minimize the stick clicking I have to do. But I wouldn't be able to slide and reload at the same time, or jump and crouch at the same time, in a FPS game if those were mapped on the same grip.- The thumbstick caps are a little slippery. I recommend a pair of Skull & Co. PS5-style rubber caps to put over them.- Flydigi has done away with the extra bumpers they had on the Apex 2 controller. I loved those, and more inputs is always better, so it's a bummer they're not here.- As of writing, this controller's back buttons and C/Z buttons aren't supported by reWASD remapping software. If you're a reWASD user, you'll need to remap the back buttons and C/Z buttons in Flydigi's software first, then fully close the software to allow the other reWASD mappings to work.- While quality control seems exceptional, the build quality is just OK. The plastics used don't feel very premium, and there's no rubber to found anywhere. So it's a step down comfort-wise from something like the Elite Series 2.  "

I spent a week doing research and watching videos. This one was featured on a Gamer Heaven (youtube) review. The guy there seems to focus heavily on gaming controllers, specifically. He even put this down as his ""controller of the year"" (overall) for 2023. Most reviews I saw for it though, were mostly very positive. It happened to have all of the features (or the most of any controller I looked at) that I was looking for; hall effect sticks, adjustable triggers, remappable back buttons, haptic triggers, fast polling rate, etc. I had considered spending upward of $200 on the Xbox elite, but was worried about talks of the controllers having stick drift issues, out of the box (and not being replaceable). The DS5 Edge was also expensive, and although it had replaceable sticks, they were mechanical. For less than $100, this bad boy had all of the features I was looking for. I am loving it so far...mostly...The software is pretty bad and a lot of the instructions I have found online are in Chinese. I have had a bit of trouble remembering the instructions for switching from X-input to Direct Input, etc. And when I try to google the button combos to change it, most of what comes up is for a different model, or isn't in English..so that is annoying. I also don't LOVE the fact that it has the holes on top for their mobile device accessory, which I will never use. I do wish the grips were rubbery (like the xbox pro). that is maybe preference, but easy enough to ""fix"" with a set of rubber grip accessories that I purchased. It feels great now. I also wish the back buttons were removeable switches instead of static buttons. You can turn them off if they are annoying. But, they are often nice to have in a lot of games. I just thing the paddle style switches like the ones on the Elite or Edge controllers seem a lot nicer. But this controller at least had back buttons at all, which many other 3rd party controllers (under $150-200) did not. I also think the Vader 2 looked better. I am not a fan of the blue/grey/silver colorway. But, again, that is personal preference. The ability to change the RGB is nice. I also don't love the asymmetrical joysticks, but have gotten used to them. Many folks will maybe prefer these.  Also preference would be that the controller was a BIT heavier. It feels pretty good, and not cheap by any means. But when I pick up my friend's XBOX Elite controller, I am a little sad mine doesn't have that premium feel. But that also comes at a 2x the price tag.All in all, I love the controller for the price. I wish there were a few things done differently, but I don't think you can do much better for $80, honestly.  "
"16","Kyle T. Prahl","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars","        I want to start off by stating that I love this controller, it has many great features not found in many “premium” controllers, for a fraction of the cost. If you’ve found your way to this controller, then I’m sure you’re aware of its biggest selling point - Hall effect joysticks. They work very well thus far! I mostly play FPS games, and the fact that these joysticks are always centered, even with zero deadzone, escalates my gameplay to another level. Be aware you should set the deadzone in the app, as well as in the settings of whatever game you’re playing. One thing to note regarding Hall effect controllers is that although they are less prone to stick drift, they are not immune. The quality of the spring used in the joystick may be the factor that determines its longevity. Other awesome features I like include the clicky, tactile feel of the buttons and trigger - I don’t think I can ever go back to mushy buttons ever again! The gyro function gives me a little more control with aiming. Also, the app works pretty well now. I know some users had a bad experience with the app, but it looks like with the newer version, they were able to solve many bugs as I haven’t had any real issues with it.Now onto the less-than-ideal features (but still good). The back buttons could be better. I find them to be too small and only somewhat ergonomically placed. Competitors have much more intuitive back buttons, some even replaceable with different angles to fit your hand better. I also didn’t like the joystick caps not because of the caps themselves but since I like putting kontrolfreeks on the caps, neither the PS or Xbox ones fit. I ended up opening the thing, which by the way smells like cancer (ie melted plastic), and replaced the joysticks with Xbox ones. With kontrolfreeks and restrictor rings on, short triggers, and all the other awesome features, my gameplay has been next level!I also did some software latency testing (ie theoretical) and was getting about 2-3 ms and 500hz polling rate. Would love this even more if I could overclock this thing. I’m in the process of obtaining a hardware latency tester but others have already tested the latency of this device and many others - search for “Gamepadla”. The Vader 3 pro scored fairly well against other controllers!Note that this review only reflects dongle and wired connections. I’ve yet to try this in switch and have read that the Bluetooth is not great.Overall I’m very pleased. I am curious to see how long these sticks maintain being centered, only time would tell! If you’re on the fence, just get it, it’s fairly cheap and its joysticks would likely last longer than any premium controller with analog sticks. I would never buy analog joysticks again to be honest!  "
"17","SethJChat","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        For the money, this controller packs more features than its more expensive counterparts in almost every department. The overall form factor is very close to Xbox elite 2 controller. Although it is a bit slimmer. The sticks are above average. They are smooth to move quickly, but have enough tension to be precise with. The triggers are absolutely phenomenal with the ability to adjust between full pull and mouse click actuations on the fly. The buttons are mechanical and have a nice tactile click as beedback. The inner paddles are placed well to actually be usable. One quirk I have found with the controller is that it will sometimes lose its connection while using it wired. The only real complaint I have is with the software.. there isn’t any. At least not that you can download from the manufacturer. That limits and eliminates some of the features out of the box.UPDATE:::: AS OF 11/20/23 the website now has a working version of the GameCenter software to allow mapping and macros to be set on the controller. With this edition and the latest controller driver, I’d have to say this thing beats out MOST controllers on the market. Unless you are planning on buying a custom PC controller like the Scuf Envision Pro, or something like it this is a hard sale to beat.  "
"18","Hub Go","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        All around very solid performance.SpaceStation software is nice however there seems to be a bug that recognizes two inputs at times, not sure why it happens but it seems related to changing configs.I'm on Windows 10 / Steam / Rocket League. I like the USB wireless mode and I found that starting the software and connecting the controller before jumping into a game works best. I also disabled Steam Input.The button pad might not be mecha-tactile like the Apex 3 Elite but they feel nice. Though I can't spam buttons as fast as I used to on my DS4. Buttons are a little smaller than the DS4 buttons also.Concave thumbsticks took a little getting used to coming from DS4, and they are swappable, however there are only the two that came with the controller. I would like to see a Thumbstick pack from Flydigi with some convex and different height options.Hall effect sensors seem to work nicely.Good value.  "
"19","thejazmyster","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I spent a lot of time researching controllers. It always felt like one would have some of the features I wanted, but be missing others. I really blew my mind that in 2024 there wasn't a reliable company producing a PlayStation layout controller with hall effect, paddles on the rear, a good dpad and trigger stops.Obviously the PlayStation controller layout is a preference and I don't have an issue using the Xbox layout, it's simply what I would've liked.I'm here to say, that the Vader 3 Pro is as close to perfect a controller as I've found in checking the boxes I care about.As a PC player, I've found that many manufacturers lie about a lot of product features, especially polling rates. There's not the case there. I've gotten consistent 500 polling rates for as long as I've been using this pad.The sticks feel great, the tactile buttons assure me of my inputs and the dpad is so close to amazing.So what's the ""almost""? The button just to the lower right of the dpad that enables gyro is too close. I've on several occasions while playing Street Fighter 6 performed a shoryuken and hit it, which then has a mouse icon flying all over my screen.I wasn't able to find a way to disable this button in the software, which made me disappointed as I have zero intention of using this button, even when playing FPS.At this price point, I almost feel this is unbeatable. The quality far outweighs what few complaints I have about this gamepad and I encourage anyone who can tolerate or likes the Xbox layout to give it a shot.  "
"20","thejazmyster","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I play a lot of Call of Duty on PC and have various pro controllers Xbox elite, Turtle beach stealth pro, kk3 max, Razer wolverine V2, all the scuffs and a few others, but nothing compares to the feel of the Vader 3 pro. The back buttons took a few days to get used to and I wasn't happy with the idea of using one finger for each set of back buttons but it actually feels better then the elite style back buttons when you get used to them. And the analog sticks are great I keep trying my other controllers but, none have the feel of the Vader sticks. And the mouse triggers are great they have a few mm travel very easy to click without any misclicks. Polling rate is around 1-2 ms. I did have to reach out to tech support for a firmware issue and the sent me a link to a new update when that didn't work they sent me a new controller within in 2 days. So needless to say I would recommend this controller for PC over any other one sold on the market today and look forward to the Vader 4 pro.  "
"21","Rich","Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        The Flydigi Vader 3 Pro checks all the boxes for what you'd want in a controller. It features Halldeck Thumbsticks to combat stick drift, includes four buttons on the back and an additional two on the front, along with superb triggers. The ease of customization through a PC App or an iPhone app is a huge plus. It's also perfectly compatible with the Nintendo Switch, offering complete button remapping and the option to program combos for fighting games. I absolutely adore it! When playing Warzone, the thumbsticks do a stunning 500 Hz pull rate via the 2.4 GHz adapter a wired.There’s so much more you can do with it. But for that you really gotta get your hands on it and find out! This device is truly remarkable! I retired my GameSir G7 SE and Join The Flydigi Family!  "
"22","Rj Thompson","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I've been waiting for hall effect controller to be released that had sensible bottom buttons and it turns out to be FLYDIGI. If you aren't interested in Hall Effect or don't even know what that is then there are probably better controllers out there that cost more. For those of us who are absolutely sick of having to constantly fix or purchase a new controller because of stick drift then you already have purchased a controller with Hall Effect sticks but the options are limited. Most don't even have back buttons. I had purchased a Gamesir previously and it performed great but the back buttons were placed in such a way that if you held the controller tight during a period of furious action you couldn't help but press them. It was maddening that when making a mistake was the most costly was almost always the time you'd accidentally touch them. I started checking Amazon on a regular basis for controllers that would be new products that included Hall Effect sticks and sensible back buttons. A few days ago the FLYDIGI Vader 3 Pro shows up in my product search and here we are. After having used it for over 24 hours I can say it's perfect. The software is not intuitive but has all the features that any other competent manufacturer has. Nice job, FLYDIGI!  "
"23","Art B","Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I've been using this controller for about 8 months of daily 3 - 4 hours MW2 / MW3 sessions.  I have had ZERO issues. I recently purchased the new TB Ultra due to it having hall effect sticks. I went right back to my Vader 3 Pro.  So now my $199 "" elite / pro controller"" sits on the shelf. I recommend this controller to anyone asking for a replacement  due to analog stick drift issues with their current controller. You can beat the price for what you get. I will now be a life long user of the Vader 3 Pro. I've put it through hell and back and its as good as day one.  "
