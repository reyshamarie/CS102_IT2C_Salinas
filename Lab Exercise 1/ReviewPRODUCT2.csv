"3","Daniel","Reviewed in Australia on 28 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        Love Fire Stick and now have 2. Even though we have smart TV's have one of these plugged into each of them as they stream without glitches and buffering.Have all my apps on the stick so I can stream from my Amazon Prime account as well as Binge, Disney etc.Easy to use and set up and you can use just one remote to turn on and off the TV and control Volume so make it easier.We stream Normal Chanels through this stick also like 7 and 10 which makes it the only device we use with our TV's. Would highly recommend Fire TV sticks to anyone much better than the old Google Chrome stick we used to use.  "

"10","Paul Hession","Reviewed in Australia on 26 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        After buying 1 to test I ended up replacing all the Chromecasts (3) in the house. These are much better.Like the Chromecast you can side load Android apps that can be handy for those annoying Ads.  "
