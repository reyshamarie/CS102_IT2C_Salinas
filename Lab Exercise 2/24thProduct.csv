Bought for mainly podcast and music and prefer the sound profile over my air pod pros.Tried with gaming, and if you plan to play anything with guns and shooting I think these are a little harsh and fatiguing. I would suggest spending within the $150-$300aud area if games are your main focus.On a side note, the build quality for this price range is kind of mind boggling.  "

Estos IEMs presentan una claridad y precisión a la que no tienen derecho por el precio que tienen. Vienen avalados por Crinacle, que para los que no seáis del mundo del audio, viene a ser el referente en análisis de este tipo de auriculares.Lo que sí me ha sorprendido, es ver una reseña que a la vez usa la palabra sibilancia y dice que el sonido es sucio y sin graves. Amigo, sácate la cera de los oídos.Por el precio que tienen, son compra recomendadísima. Eso sí, a tener en cuenta que aislan bastante del sonido exterior, si quieres algo más abierto, no son para ti.    "
"8","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ","Kike","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 13 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I daily drive the original zeros at work, and picked this up as replacements for a set i use offsite.  The standard zeroes have excellent audio quality, great comfort, remain in-ear at all times (due to the quite comfortable over the ear hook), and were absurd value for the price.The Zero:2's are all of that still, but they somehow managed to improve the audio quality more.  It's not like the Zeroes are bad by any means, I mean I'm writing this as I have the originals on my head right now.  What I can say though is that you will not be disappointed if you purchase these either as a fresh purchase or upgrades from your existing set.And then there's the price.  I purchased these for roughly $20 USD.  Normally for that price in stores, you'll end up with a pair of earbuds that will stop working in six months.  I have been using the original Zeroes for a year now and have yet to have any hiccups at all with them.The one downside is the cord length.  It is well constructed and highly durable, but it is also on the shorter side.  I use my headphones to go from my desktop mounted workstation to my head.  It's not that far of a distance, maybe 2ft tops.  The length of the cord is roughly 3ft, so that's not bad for most users, and if you're just going from a laptop, handheld, or mobile it's going to be fine.  However if you do have a bit of a longer run, you may want to pick up a headphone extension cable along with this.  "

Et les autres oreillettes fournies sont... plus petites. Donc, direction ma réserve d'oreillettes en mousse de chez Klim (diamètre 4,9mm).Une fois tout en place, j'ai un son comme je l'aime : clair sans être criard, précis, des graves honorables mais pas baveux : un pur bonheur, à tarif doux. Et je ne l'ai pas encore rôdé !D'aucuns prétendent qu'il faut s'empresser de changer de câble : peut-être. Pour l'instant, celui d'origine me convient, bien que trop court. J'essaierai sans doute plus tard, par curiosité.Bref, vous l'aurez compris, je recommande vivement ce casque intra AVEC des embouts en mousse adaptés. Je ne peux pas parler du rendu avec les embouts d'origine et d'un embout à l'autre, le son peut beaucoup changer sur des intras.    "

Bassen zijn diep en rijk, maar overheersen niet. Het hoog is nooit schreeuwerig of snijdend, maar netjes gedefiniëerd.De accessoires zijn niet om over naar huis te schrijven, maar wat verwacht je voor dit geld.

"12","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ","Karlito","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in France on 23 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Ho comprato questi iem economici mentre cercavo un prodotto decisamente più costoso. Ho deciso di comprare queste perché straconsigliate su molto forum audiofili, per poi continuare poi la mia ricerca di un prodotto di altro livello. Quasi mi hanno fatto passare la voglia di cercare iem più costosi. Non sono assolutamente gli auricolari più risoluti, o coi tecnicismi migliori, anzi, siamo sulla sufficienza, ma la loro musicalità, chiarezza e separazione, sono incredibili per il prezzo pagato. Suonano decisamente meglio delle mie Oppo Enco x pagate 4 volte di piu e anche meglio delle airpod 2. (Non credo possano suonare meglio delle pro). Questo è un ottimo iem per chi vuole un ascolto rilassato, cablato, spendendo una cifra ridicola. Per chi cerca un ascolto critico non la consiglio solo per via dell'economicità del driver. Bassi ce ne sono, ma non è un auricolare per le teste di basso, la sua caratteristica principale è la chiarezza. Difetti: il gommini in dotazione sono parecchi ma sono di qualità mediocre, non si aggrappano bene e tendono un po' scivolare, di quel tanto che basta a cambiare il suono in peggio. Questo anche per colpa del cavo che curva troppo presto e tende a tirare l""auricolare spostandolo un po' dalla sua posizione originale. Comunque difficile trovare di meglio per poco più di 20 euro    "
"13","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ","Nico Meijer","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 31 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Nachdem ich bereits die Vorgängerversion besitze und damit super zufrieden war, habe ich mir aus Neugier natürlich auch die Zero:2 Version gegönnt. Das Klangbild hat mir bereits beim Zuspiel vom Handy sehr gut gefallen.Ergänzt um ein Tripowin Zonie 16 Core Kabel mit 4.4mm symmetrischer Klinke am Hiby R5 Gen2 kann man die Qualität der Kopfhörer jedoch erst richtig ausreizen. Ein wahrer Hörgenuss und kein Vergleich zur 3,5 Stereo Klinke. Die Kopfhörer haben ein für meinen Geschmack sehr ausgewogenes Klangbild und liefern eine konstant gute Leistung bis in Sphären, die ich von der Lautstärke her meinen Ohren nicht mehr zumuten möchte.Wer als Otto-Normalverbraucher guten Klang möchte baucht also absolut nicht tief in die Tasche zu greifen. Für die wahren audiophilen Zeitgenossen kann es natürlich immer etwas mehr sein :DIch denke ich werde mir bei Zeiten noch ein Reserve-Paar besorgen für alle Fälle. im Austausch für das mit den 7Hz x Crinacle Zero:2 mitgelieferten 3,5mm Klinkenkabel gekauft um endlich den symmetrischen Anschluss meines neuen gebrauchten Hiby R5 Gen2 nutzen zu können. Was soll ich sagen - klanglich liegen Welten zwischen der Audioleistung der Stereo-Klinke zum symmetrischen Anschluss. Das Kabel hat die Kopfhörer nochmals stark aufgewertet und ist somit jeden Cent wert. Optisch sieht es auch noch super aus und ist top verarbeitet und haptisch ein Erlebnis. Klare Kaufempfehlung daher von mir.    "

"15","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ","Christian Görgen","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the Netherlands on 29 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Background: I work with video, sound design, animation and 3D modelling. I use headphones rather than speakers (I have studio monitor speakers) to master the audio, music, sound effects and foley sounds in projects. I will listen to the mixdown both on headphones and then the studio monitors afterwardsMy Needs: Clear, Distortion-free, Full sounding headphones (with no artificial noise cancellation or artificially boosted frequencies) that capture the nuance of sound from the deep rumble of earth tremors to the whine of mechanical gears moving and still be able to throw on a playlist of drum & bass or chunky house music to groove to while creating landscapes, pre-vis concepts, modelling or sculpting.I read up on all sorts of headphones and IEMs, checked on reviews, consulted with friends with similar backgrounds, surprisingly, these IEMs came recommended by several connections and reviewers. I had a hard time believing that a pair of $40 in-ear monitors could compete with my Shure 535's (that died) and the Pioneer DJE-2000's that I used as a club dj.**Before I go into a review I will say that I purchased the Linsoul Tripowin 16-core IEM cable the same time I purchased these monitors and have not used the included 4-core standard cable. More on that later.**PROS:1. PRICE! Hands down this is the number one advantage to these IEMs. I don't need to expand on that too much, $37.99 CDN for this quality is ridiculous.2. SOUND: 10Hz-20KHz frequency range is also ridiculous. The added 3db of base from the previous model 7hz Zero does punch up the bass in music some but not to the point of creating crackling distortion or sound 'fake' when listening to spoken words vs music. For creators, the added depth (10Hz from usual 20Hz) of frequency and low end warmth created by the 3db boost is magnificent whether authoring music for an animation, creating layers of sound effects for atmosphere or mastering spoken words in video .. the sound is clean, neutral, and true to what you will hear in playback. (Unlike consumer brand bass heavy, augmented headphones).3. CLARITY: As above, very clean and true-to-life sound reproduction whether used on PC, Mac, smart phone or tablet. These just sound good, period. After a total of 20 hours of testing I found no discernible ear fatigue.4. COMFORT: I spend a lot of time in front of a computer with headphones on, comfort is #1 1/2 after sound quality. I opened the box, installed the cable and kept these in-ear for more than 4 hours without noticing any discomfort. I can easily see myself doing a straight 8 hours (or more) without issue. The units are light enough, fit the ear very well, are stable when turning from screen-to-screen and typing/drawing/mousing. 5-stars for comfort alone.5. Linsoul Tripowin 16-core replacement cable .. Truth be told, I haven't bothered to plug in the supplied 4-core cable that came with the Zero:2. I bought the replacement cable at the same time as the IEMs for a reason, more cores-more sound. If you read this and choose to buy the 7hz+Crinacle Zero:2 IEMs, buy this cable. Don't think, just add it to your cart and thank me later. Very well made, easy to install, and the sound ... well, core number counts for something, there's a reason CPUs are getting more cores and threads year-over-year.Now, CONS:1. STD CABLE: Supply the 16-core cable standard and add $10 to the retail price. People will still buy the replacements, but c'mon guys, give the drivers the love they deserve.1a. CABLE LENGTH: The Tripowin cable is 1.25m and the included cable is marginally shorter. These are fine lengths for hooking up to a remote transmission system for musicians ... when working on a PC or Mac desktop, well, it's a bit short if I'm being honest. Maybe this is splitting hairs, but, if there was a way to have a .85m main cable and include a 1m extension, that would be ideal for those of us tied to a desk rather than rippin' a phat guitar solo.2. NO FOAM EAR TIPS ?!?!? This kinda hurt a bit. I loathe silicon ear tips, always have and always will. Yes, Shure and Pioneer cost 5-10 times the price of the Zero:2, they also come standard with both silicon and Comply tips. I'm not saying Linsoul needs to include Comply, however, for me I know that heat sensitive foam tips create a better seal in-ear and therefore cancels out 95% of background noise allowing me to significantly lower the volume and saving my ear drums from the fatigue of daily sustained audio vibrations. PUT FOAM TIPS IN THE PACKAGE, charge an extra $5 if you must, your customers will thank you.3. NO CASE ... I mean really? This should just be a standard, not an upgrade. I can't think of a single reason a case is not an automatic addition to the purchase. Does anyone at Linsoul have a cat at home, include a case and save the rest of us from having to find kitty's new toy after we make a sandwich.Overall, I give these 4.8 Stars for the important things; SOUND, COMFORT, PRICE. Points were deducted for the important nice-to-haves; NO FOAM TIPS, 4-CORE STD CABLE, NO CASE. The Cons weren't enough for me to reduce the initial joy of listening to these IEMs for the first time BUT they are something the manufacturer should think about when/if the Zero:3 is being designed and packaged.Hope this helps some of the fence sitters and head scratchers.Peace, Love & Good Music .. also Happy New Year.

"16","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ","Gerson","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Italy on 9 February 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars","        The Zero 2 Dynamic Driver in-ear monitors deliver a remarkable audio experience, especially considering their price point of £25.99. The sub-bass is deep and impressive, providing a rich, immersive listening experience. The highs are noteworthy, crisp and clear, making every note feel alive.As I spent more time with these in-ear monitors, I was continuously amazed by their moment-to-moment fidelity. The sound quality is so exceptional that it may set a new standard for your audio expectations. Indeed, once you've experienced the Zero 2, you may discover that only top-tier speaker systems are comparable in sound quality.What is truly astonishing is how these IEMs perform once you fine-tune them with some equalisation. They reach a level of performance that can only be described as world-class. When you feed these in-ear monitors well-recorded music, the experience is transformative, placing you at the very pinnacle of high-fidelity sound.The Zero 2 in-ear monitors offer excellent audio quality at this price point. If you're in the market for IEMs, make an intelligent choice with these. They provide outstanding performance at an affordable price of just £25.99, which is unparalleled.  "

Comparé à mon casque Sennheiser HD-25, il offre plus de détails et d'aération. La courbe fréquentielle en Harman (courbe fréquentielle statistiquement la plus appréciée) y est sans doute pour quelque chose.Comparé aux HD-600 (un casque à presque 20x son prix !), il fait plus que bien se défendre ! Plus facile à driver que le HD-600, plus de grave et d'aigus que le HD-600, peut-être un médium un peu moins relax (le Sennheiser étant un casque ouvert, il est plus agréable sur la durée), un niveau de détail équivalent.Le câble est peut-être un peu fragile mais pour l'instant il fait l'affaire.

"22","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ","Mr N Thorpe","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in France on 22 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        My 1st time purchasing a set of iem's. I love how these sound nice bass pretty clear all through out. If i use on tablet in 3.5mm jack or c type to 3.5mm dongle on s22plus or on hidizs s9pro dacamp on my cell with amazon music app they sound awesome. Even on xbox controller watching flix or movies purchased. Pretty loud piercing highs when powerd with dac amp powering them or not same goes with bass but stays pretty clear on either of these 4 ways i use these zero 2. If these are lower sounding high notes compared to the og zeros? Im pretty interested in trying the og pair to see how they compare in future. Pretty inexpensive iem's but very good sounding. Red tips that came with iems were good and worked but i found that i love the comply tips 500 series fit size medium for my ear canals. Got new 0.78mm 2 pin 3.5mm cord for this as well. No need to do that though the 5 or 6 tips and cord that come provided with iems works perfectly fine. I'll prob buy a set of these for people down the road as well as gift for music lovers or movie watchers. No microphone built in if anyone is looking for that i believe the og zero by linsoul 7hz have a built in mic on cord. No distortion on full volume cranked up with dac amp i use amazon music app for my tunes. No need for dac amp to enjoy these, plug into any 3.5mm port and they sound great! Nothing broken or missing when I received & opened package.  Only thing you will probably need to buy or find is little baggy or hard case to carry around if want to use while out & about.  "

Very comfortable in the ear at least for me. The build quality is also very nice at this price, it is mostly made of a hard plastic, but the the stainless steel backplate is a very nice detail and makes these feel rather upscale in the hand.

"27","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ","Family","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars","        It's just a straight improvement to the original unless you were extremely attached to the frequency response - lots of people would eq the bass up a bit and slightly reduce treble if they found it too much - you could think of the zero 2 as having those eq changes already applied. Other than that it's the same insane value, with a better plastic shell (i went with the turquoise colourway), better cable, and allegedly better driver. I couldn't tell you whether the driver is actually better, to me it sounds about the same sound clarity as the original, just with slightly more ""fullness"" from a better bass response.The only arguments against this for me are 1. You liked the relatively anemic bass response of the original (compared to rivals like the tangzu wa'ner) - i didn't mind it personally but I was also one of the people who did bump up the low freqs by a couple dB2. You already have the original and don't want to spend the money again on what is effectively only a slight upgrade. It's better imo, but not so much that I'd say you should run out and get them if youre already happy with your current 7hz zeros3. you tried the original and they didn't fit you. the shape is exactly the same here.

"30","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ","Stefano","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 1 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Best performing IEMS in this price range. If you want a noticeable upgrade, you can get the Zero Reds from truth ear that crinnacle also tuned but they are double the price. To get an upgrade past that point you're looking in the 300$ range.I would say it gets 4/5 on sound quality because of how shouty and fatiguing they get, at least for me personally. Basically, sounds great on anything really bass/mid heavy but vocals, especially female or high treble male vocals can really hurt your ears after awhile and sound flat.Prefer the more natural tone of the Crinnacle Zero Reds from truth ear but I keep destroying those at work and these are a good alternative that idc if they get destroyed because they are 20 dollars.Some of you buying these might be just journeying into IEM world let me just tell you tips are everything. Getting a correct fit with a good seal completely changes how IEMS will sound. I would personally pair these with good aftermarket tips to get the most bang for your buck. Personally have Render tips which are honestly more expensive than the IEMs and it massively enhancing the sound quality.  "

"34","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ","Tassinari Sergio","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 30 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Needed something to practice piano and produce music on Logic. These have replaced by Beyer Dynamic 880s which have started to cause my face to go numb! I haven’t A/B’ed them, but these IEMs give a great sound that’s surprisingly flat, with no hyped up bass or shrill highs. Certainly good enough for what I need and will try mixing on them at some point. They get hyped quite a bit and I’d say with good reason.UPDATE: Had them a month or so. The manufacturer said they’d need twenty hours to break in. Done that and the bass on them when watching movies is phenomenal. They’re pretty flat in their response too. I’ve upgraded the cable and will def use these for production and mixing. Blown away by the quality and value for money.  "

"39","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ",NA,"Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 22 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I purchased these iems based on multiple reviews and these are amazing for a low price. They sound as good as many iems well above $100!  They are tuned well and are good for a wide variety of music from rock to jazz to pop!  Don’t hesitate and just buy these… you will not be disappointed.  Bass is nice and punchy, mids are fairly detailed and treble is good (although on the verge of sibillant for me)Cable is not the best, but this is not a high cost iem, so it is forgivable.  Make sure you select a tip that fits in your ears as the bass will not be as prevalent as you would expect.  When you have the right tips, these are magical… and for only $25!Linsoul as a vendor is excellent.  Shipping was prompt and items were received a couple of days earlier than anticipated.  "

Der Sound ist super klar und die Kopfhörer schirmen auch gut die Umgebung ab.Ich hab die Kopfhörer vor allem für Chunithm und MaiMai gekauft. In der Arcade wird es häufiger Mal laut, ein klarer Sound in lauter Umgebung ist daher ideal!    "

Much better than my headphones that cost 10x as much, and more comfortable, too.  I've always resisted IEMs before, but now I am a convert!  "

I like how the cable can be replaced if damaged as that's always broke for me on ones you cannot change. Pity phone makers don't take hq sound seriously, I'd like to use a reasonable usb c dac like the apple one but the volume is too low for use on my phone in the uk.  "
"47","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ",NA,"Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 4 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Il mercato degli auricolari, o IEM, è in forte crescita. Per questo si sono diffusi prodotti dal costo esorbitante. Non fatevi ingannare dal prezzo: anche spendendo cifre modeste si possono acquistare oggetti di ottimo livello. La confezione di questi auricolari è spartana, anche il cavo è veramente basic. Tuttavia, come dimostrano le misurazioni di Amir su Audiosciencereview, la resa è veramente molto alta. La risposta in frequenza è vicina alla curva Harmann per l'ascolto in cuffia. La distorsione è bassissima su tutte le frequenze. Ciò significa che se si collegano a un Pc si  può attuare l'equalizzazione senza difficoltà ottenedo una restituzione ideale del messaggio sonoro. Infine l'elevata sensibilità implica che anche un dac-amplificatore di potenza modesta può ""pilotarli"" a dovere. In definitiva, se si utilizza il Pc come streamer e DSP - con programmi gratuiti come EQ Apo, basta considerare una spesa minima di alcune decine di euro per un Dac/amplificatore di buon livello per un ascolto veramente soddisfacente. Se non equalizza la risposta in frequenza l'ascolto è soddisfacente ma manca un po' di apertura in alto.    "
"48","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ",NA,"Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 18 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I have not been happy with any of the wireless earbuds or headphones I have tried, because they don't fit great, I'm constantly losing/dropping them, and they don't sound as good as wired. I have a million pairs of wired Apple earbuds that sound OK, but don't fit my ears at all without aftermarket silicone tips that constantly fall off and need to be replaced. I have some cheap JBLs that actually sound pretty decent but also have sort of giant tips that hurt my ears after a while. I think I have small, cone-shaped ear canals that spit out earbuds or something. The external part of my ear also seems to be too small to cradle most wireless earbuds so they are always loose.I'd like to thank GenZ for introducing me to IEMs, which I previously knew only as those things kpop idols wear on stage, and had no idea one could purchase for simply listening to music. These fit my ears perfectly with the smallest tips installed and they sound (to me) amazing. I am not an audiophile, and I am definitely not a sound engineer, but I am much, much happier with the sound quality of these than I have been with any wired earbuds I've tried, especially for $25. I could also easily go jogging with these on without worrying they'd fall out, even if they were not wired. I love that I can just pop one out of an ear and leave it hanging to hear someone talking to me without fumbling it trying to store it in a pocket like I do with wireless buds.Anyway, thanks to Marco Renna for writing the review that finally convinced me to buy these (Amazon won't let me like his review for some reason). I followed his advice and also ordered the 16-core cable upgrade in fashionable purple. I haven't tried the included cable so I can't comment on sound quality differences but I'll take his word for it.The only issues I have are that I would like to have a mic so that I could take calls on these and it would be great to be able to control the volume and start/stop music from the cable, but these are fairly minor tradeoffs for the sound quality and the fact that they fit my ears this well. I can see how some users with small ears might have issues, but not me.  "
