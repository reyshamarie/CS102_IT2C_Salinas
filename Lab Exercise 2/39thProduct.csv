There is some clarity, some separation and somewhat of a soundstage. All this boils down to IEMs that are not stellar, but reasonably accurate (little dark), non-fatiquing and pretty easy to listen to both casually and critically.If you are on a budget, these are really a no-brainer. If you already have or can afford better IEMs these are no brainer too: they make excellent spare, hand-out or loan headphones and so on. And they still sound nice enough to listen to even when you have more expensive options.Comfort-wise these are tiny and non-obtrusive. They can be put as deeply in ear as you want, and it won't be a drastic reduction of sound if they are not all the way in. Of course, you can also put them all the way in, for me they go about as deep as etymotics go, i can't actually grab their body anymore and have to pull out via cable.Isolation is pretty good on deep fit, long-term comfort too, i can sit with those for hours. In fact they sort of disappear very soon after you place them in and i really don't feel them at all.Sound-wise they are  sort of target-neutralish, gravitating towards warm sound quite a bit. No harshness or sibilance, no boomy basses, everything is pretty neat. Clarity and separation do exist, although won't be much to write home about.Drive wise, they sound OK from iPhone+Apple dongle, plugging them in any sort of amp though noticeably increases dynamics and makes them less flat. You do get additional resolution/space when going through external DAC+Amp compared to phone, so some amping won't hurt.Summarizing, these are decent headphones. They are better than most mass-market stuff like Skullcandy, etc. They are better than most earphones that come bundled with phones (although samsung/akg ones might give a bit of run for money).10-15 years ago these IEMs would be considered extremely impressive for any price. Given the price, though, they are extremely impressive right now as well.  "

Let's start with my IEM journey so far.Besides for a couple tws pairs, these are my first IEM. The main reason I bought them: low price and I figured it would be a good enough way to see if I could stand IEMs for daily use over headphones. When I first got these, I of course started to compare them with my main headphones at the time, the Yamaha HPH MT5 with brainwavz angled pads. The first thing I noticed coming from those headphones is that the quarks obviously are lacking in sheer resolution. But again, that is obvious. These are $13. MT5s are $100. Trying to ignore that, I started listening to some music. Initially, the quarks lacked any kind of bass for me simply because the bass is boosted on the MT5. But what I remember most from that initial day of testing is being mind blown that the tuning on the quarks overall sounded more ""correct"" to me than on my headphones. I didn't really know why at the time, but the tonality of the MT5 was just off. And I preferred the tuning on something that is $13. That alone was worth it.So with that, I researched other IEMs. Long story short, I landed on the Tripowin x HBB Mele and Moondrop Aria. Mele filters caused channel imbalance after 2 weeks, and the Arias broke in a day.I also got the TRN MT1 for a great price, so I tried them and they are okay for what they are. V shaped tuning, nothing special but I was surprised that I can even enjoy music on them for how cheap they are.So... after that bad luck with qc on the 2 most expensive pairs I tried... I went back to the quarks. I had used them for about a month or 2 as a daily driver before chirstmas because I wanted to get used to them. I don't believe in driver burn-in, but I believe in mental burn-in. Man, are these things great now that my brain has fully gotten used to the tuning.The sub bass is still pretty much non-existent to my ears, but I think that is because the driver is just too small to reproduce those frequencies. Something that did change since using them more is now I feel that there is an acceptable amount of mid bass/warmth in that area. Not a ton of punch, but enough to where I don't feel like there is absolutely nothing.The mids sound... fine? I don't really have a ton to say because I am not super experienced with audio stuff yet. I will say that obviously these are lacking in a bit of detail and separation, but it's still surprising what detail and separation exists. I still find myself getting surprised at picking up some smaller details in tracks that I listen to. I just never thought I would be able to hear what I can with these. They are certainly not the best, just shocking at the price. I will say that vocals can generally get a bit shouty to my ears though sometimes. Just something to keep in mind.The treble on these seems adequate enough. I sometimes notice things getting a tad harsh to my ears but I haven't noticed distortion or anything with cymbals. I think this kind of blends in with the “shout” I was talking about. Again, surprising for how dirt cheap they are.TL;DR - Better longevity than more expensive stuff I have tried, but I have had terrible luck. The bottom line is that these are very enjoyable to listen to, and in my opinion, a no brainer for how cheap they are. Just try them, give them a REAL chance, and if you don't like them you aren't out much money. Build quality, though not great, doesn't feel like they will fall apart. I still feel like I have understated how much I like the quarks, but I am trying to be as realistic as possible here.  "

I've been into headphones for a number of years, but have never really ventured into IEM's, until I heard that serviceable sound quality could be had for basically a tenner. I didn't believe it to be honest, but though I'd take the chance on them, and I'm so glad I did! I'm not gonna say that they have comparable sound quality to 300 quid audiophile headphones, but they are definitely serviceable as a daily driver.Pretty flat and neutral with a bit of a sub-bass boost makes for a pretty pleasant sound. Not the crispiest sound by any stretch, could be a bit clearer in the upper mids and treble but the impressive sound stage makes up for that in my opinion. 9/10 for sound, (taking cost into account obviously)Comfort and build quality wise they are very impressive! Especially in comfort, they are absolutely tiny, you can barely see them in your ear when wearing, and they're perfect for sleeping with. The cable feels sturdy enough whilst also being fairly flexible. There are some sharper edges on the plastic housing of the IEM's which is a bit of a shame but all in all, well worth the moneyDefinitely worth picking up.  "

""V-shaped Headphones"". Hierunter versteht man eine Abmischung bei der die Höhen und die Bässe besonders hervorgehoben werden. Diese Ausrichtung soll besonders Spaß beim Hören machen. Naja, ich denke kurzfristig schon, aber langfristig fliegen einem die Ohren weg. Es dröhnt nur noch und man fühlt sich angeschrien.Nun zu den Quarks. Hier ist das genaue Gegenteil der Fall. Die Quarks betonen besonders die Mitten. Dies führt zu einem sehr entspannten Hören über mehrere Stunden. Insbesondere Vocals kommen natürlich beim Hörer an. Einige bezeichnen den Sound als ""neutral"". Ich finde, dass dieser Ausdruck unpassend ist. ""Natürlich"" beschreibt es besser.Wer hier die große Soundstage und Details in den Höhen und einen trockenen klaren Bass für ca. 12 € erwartet, den muss ich enttäuschen. Trotzdem solltet ihr den Quarks eine Chance geben und sie ca. 3-7 Tage täglich verwenden. Wer dann bspw. die Chu von Moondrop zum Vergleich einsetzt (auch ein richtig guter In-Ear btw) wird die Vocals als zu aufdringlich klar empfinden. Was die Quarks richtig machen, fehlt den Chu's, nämlich die sauberen Mitten. Und eins kann ich Euch versprechen: Auch euch werden sie fehlen. Also schnell wieder auf- bzw.einsetzen, durchatmen und weiterhören.Ganz kurz zum Design und zum Komfort. Mit ihrem transparenten Plastikgehäuse und ihrer geringen Größe erscheinen die Quarks dezent zurückhaltend mit einem metropolen industriellen Touch. Dies wirkt sich positiv auf das Gewicht und den Sitz im Ohr aus. Ich behaupte einmal frech, dass man mit den Teilen sogar schlafen kann. Man sollte allerdings aufpassen, dass man sich mit dem Kabel im Schlaf nicht erdrosselt. Ich habe bislang viele InEars probiert und alle haben in meinen Ohren folgendes Problem: Sie fallen schlicht alle nach einer gewissen Zeit heraus oder müssen nachpositioniert werden. Wer Gleiches erlebt hat und aus diesem Grund keine InEars mehr ausprobieren möchte und dies hier vielleicht zufällig liest, dem sei geraten, den Quarks eine Chance zu geben. Bei mir sitzen Sie selbst nach 4 Stunden arbeiten so bombenfest und unauffällig im Ohr, dass mir beim Aufstehen das MacBook unbeabsichtigt gefolgt ist.Damit bin ich auch schon am Ende meiner Rezension angelangt. Die Quarks sind einzigartig. Einzigartig aufgrund ihrer Bauweise in Verbindung mit dem Gewicht und einzigartig aufgrund ihrer Mittenbetonung. Vielleicht fehlen solche Produkte. Produkte, die einen anderen Weg gehen. Entscheidet selbst.    "

Upper midrange peak at ~3kHz may create a slightly hollow tonality at times but is rarely noticeable. Bass region lacks some texture and definition, or could simply be described as smooth and rounded. Overall separation and clarity is also decent, but struggles slightly with soundstage.The outer portion of the housing has a pointed edge around the perimeter, and so most of the pressure will be dispersed around the ear tips, which probably does not do any favors to the noticeable amount of cable noise although far from overbearing.  Otherwise the light, compact design should provide a comfortable fit for just about anyone. The included ear tips are decent, and the nozzle design also allows for some adjustment of the tips' positioning along its length.Given the price it would be unreasonable to knock Quarks down over these minor flaws especially when they compete well above their price bracket in sound, and although my pair developed a slight channel imbalance after a couple months (so unfortunately past the return window), I still find plenty of use out of them.

Ein großteil der Musik spielt sich in den Mitten ab, die Auflösung in den Höhen könnte deutlich besser sein. Der Tiefgang bei den Bässen ist vorhanden geht aber für meinen Geschmack nicht aufgelöst genug runter. In Summe ist der Klang aber okay da der Bass nicht wie bei anderen günstigen Kopfhörern dominiert und das Klangbild verzerrt.Als direkten Konkurrent würde ich von Moondrop die Chus sehen, welche Klang besser sind aber von der Qualität nicht so langlebig.Die Kritik am Sound ist aber ein wenig unfair, da ich diese mit High End inears vergleiche (etymotic er4xr, shure se535, dt770)-Fazit:Als Bürokopfhörer zum Telefonieren sowie gelegentliches Musik hören vollkommen ausreichend und preis-leistungstechnisch uneingeschränkt empfehlenswert.

This is what is referred to as an IEM or in-ear-monitor. It is different from an earbud in that it goes in your ear rather than hang on the ear. The advantage to this is that sound doesn't leak, you can listen to your content (ie. music, movies, phone calls, podcasts) without worrying if the person next to you will hear it too.Where is this product coming from? This product is sold by a reputable Chinese company who ships it to you at no extra cost. I have bought other products from this company with an overall positive experience. Although, tracking is no up to date through Amazon the tracking number provided can be searched on many websites such as 4PX or ParcelApps.com. It takes time for it to be shipped, but it has never taken more than a few weeks once it does; which considering from where it is coming from it's impressive.Who are they? Moondrop is a company that specializes in Chi-Fi (Chinese Fidelity), they are a company primarily focused on audio quality. For this same reason even though the Quarks feels light and plasticky, the cable feels smooth and everything about its design is deliberate.Why buy these? As mentioned, Moondrop, is a Chi-Fi company, even so it is shocking how well they sound for the price. They have no business sounding as good as they do. The bass is well controlled and won't rattle your head, the mids (instruments) sound clear and the highs (vocals) do not feel harsh on your ear drums. Because they are light they are easy to carrying around and do not irritate the ear like some of the larger earphones do. For their price they make for a great stocking stuffer, or even as back up earphones if you already have a good pair.I have praised them long enough, but they do deserve it. Moondrop knew what they were doing and their 2 years of research and development for this product shows. My only complaint is that due to their size they will fall of my ears, to be fair it is mostly the left side and I might need to change the size of ear tip. The build also feels cheap, again they cost $13 or $15 (with a mic), but they also feel durable even if you were to throw it around (please don't).I ordered a second pair with the microphone, when I ordered the first time that wasn't available, to use with my phone which still has a headphone jack. It is a good gift, for others or yourself, it is a great value for the sound quality at this price. Again, even as a backup earphone you will not regret buying it.  "

Inizio col dire che il rapporto qualità prezzo è elevato; non sono auricolari hifi per audiofili, ma se la cavano egregiamente, soprattutto perchè di questa qualità a questo prezzo non se ne trovano. Dotazione ricca con sacchetta, test del cuffie in laboratorio e vari gommini in gomma di ricambio di diverse grandezze. Per il suono posso dire che sono molto flat, non aspettatevi bassi esagerati, anzi . Forse un po' di carenza la trovo li, se fossero leggermente piu' evidenziati sarebbero ottimali. Come ho detto a questo prezzo non c'è niente che possa comunque competere con questi auricolari.    "

Con equalizzatore attivo l'equilibrio timbrico approssima quello di HiFiMan Sundara che ascolto di solito. Le ho provate con l'amplificatore dedicato valvolare equipaggiato di trasformatori d'uscita che uso per le cuffie magnetoplanari a bassa impedenza; con altri amplificatori il risultato può essere diverso. Sono cuffie sensibili, adatte anche al collegamento diretto a smartphone. Appena uscite dalla scatola hanno zero bassi con suono distorto e nasale inascoltabile. Lasciatele funzionare per due ore con riproduzione a volume standard, possibilmente non nelle vostre orecchie, e assumeranno all'incirca la timbrica definitiva. Con l'equalizzazione attiva, se vi piacciono bassi senza enfasi, non sembrano affatto cuffie economiche quando il volume di ascolto non è troppo alto. I cuscinetti di silicone isolano bene dai rumori ma potrebbero essere più comodi. Il sacchettino per il trasporto è incluso nella confezione insieme a un manualetto scritto in inglese comprensibile.    "

Compared to the HD58x, the general sound signature is similar but more neutral to my ears. Contrary to other reviewers, I feel like there is an adequate amount of bass. While lacking for hip hop, it is great for almost every other genre of music. The only critique I have is the clarity. Songs with very complex tracks and instrumentation may sound muffled. However, for 13$, you can't ask for sundara-level clarity and imaging. The sound isolation is below average considering how small the chu's are. Overall: 4/5Build Quality - Nothing amazing, but so far I can't say it feels worse than apple earbuds. 4/5Comfort - Probably one of the lightest and most comfortable iems that I have tried. The tips fit very well for my ears and never fall out, but everyone's ears are different. 5/5Value- Can't be beaten for 13$. 10/5Comparisons: KZ ZS10 pro: Chu's have a much cleaner and more articulate sound. While they have less bass, they are also more comfortable and are 1/5th the price. I would choose the Chu's any day of the week.  "
