For my birthday I decided to updates to the Galaxy Buds to pair with my new Galaxy Phone. I was amazed at how much better they were than my old ones and especially love that the battery lasts a long time and also that the app provides me with so many options for customisation. Excrement happy.  "

"4","HUAWEI FreeBuds SE 2 Wireless Headphones, White, Bluetooth, Up to 40 Hours Battery Life, Lightweight and Comfortable, Balanced Sound, AU Version  ","Alexandrou99","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 11 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Amazing sound quality, very convenient and robust touch features, and impressive noise cancelling and ambient sound modes.I had been concerned about purchasing this item based on a number of negative reviews related to the noise cancelling and sound quality, but I now understand that such reviews are most likely from ocd types with a superficial grasp on the topics of signal processing and electronic hardware.If you want absolute isolation to outside noise interference, opt for industrial grade ear plugs; noise cancellation is not a magic panacea.Moreover, for the physical size and price of these earbuds, the sound quality is quite impressive. You'd likely require in excess of several thousands of dollars for custom headphones if you're looking for studio quality sound.  "

"6","HUAWEI FreeBuds SE 2 Wireless Headphones, White, Bluetooth, Up to 40 Hours Battery Life, Lightweight and Comfortable, Balanced Sound, AU Version  ","PeetL","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 30 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I previously had the Sony XM4 earbuds, but I returned them after finding the controls were inconsistent, pairing missed some of the time, and they were uncomfortable.The Galaxy Buds seem to have solved all of these. They pair easily with my phone (also a Samsung), the touch controls are reliable and responsive. I especially love the ability to long-press one earbud to open and play Spotify, this removes the ""insert earbuds, get phone from pocket, unlock phone, start Spotify, put phone back"" dance.They're also very comfortable. I have big, sitcky-out ears and these are smaller and fit much more nicely than the Sony ones. Wearing them for several hours is fine.One area where the Sony ones win is noise canceling. The Galaxy Bud 2 Pros are pretty good, but the Sonys were better. If you want distraction-free listening, these are good enough. If you need to he absolutely cocooned with your music to the exclusion of everything else, these might not meet your needs.  "

My last pair were the Jabra Elite 7, which is fantastic, I've since lost them, and the lack of a find me feature is a pain.  So I bought the Samsung Buds.  Ok,  sound quality 9/10, ANC 8/10, ambient mode 10/10, build quality 10/10The ambient mode is impressive; I can hear better with the buds in, especially if you turn on the boost mode.All in all, they're pretty good.
