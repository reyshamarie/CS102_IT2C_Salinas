Hay auriculares mejores, pero son bastante más caros. La presentación es excelente, lleva un montón de accesorios, algo inesperado para este rango de precios. Incluye cosas cómo un adaptador de 10 Ohm de impedancia qué permite mejorar los graves, 6 pares de moldes de silicona para que se adapten a cualquier tipo de oido, y un par de viscolástica (o similar) que cogen la forma de la oreja.Tanto el sonido cómo los accesorios parecen de unos auriculares del doble de precio. 5 de 5.

The improvement of sound quality was startling.Wider sound stage, better definition of instruments, perfect balance between bass, mid-range and higher frequencies.Stunning sound quality for the price. It comes with a 10 ohm adaptor to increase bass, but didn’t use it as I find the balance to be perfect for my listening tastes. But nice to see the option.The cables are of a decent quality for such a low priced IEM.As with all IEMs they take a bit of getting used to. They come with a wide range of ear tips so it was a matter of finding the ones that fit best. didn’t use the adaptor.They also look pretty sharp, with a solid, decent quality finish.  "

These are some of the nicest headphones I've ever bought, and also one of the cheapest. Also the quality of the physically is really nice for a $50 pair.They're incredibly balanced in sound, which I love. It's the main reason why they'll become my new daily drivers. The snug fit in the ear cancels outside sound really nice and they don't hurt (well, they didn't once I got the right ear cushion size - for which, they provide many different options).I'm really impressed with them overall. 10/10 would recommend to literally anyone.

I was skeptical at first, but was quickly proven wrong by the outstanding sound the zero reds produce. Better than any regular earbud I've ever had! Best bang for your buck! They come with a large selection of silicone bits and one set of foam bits. The foam bits are my favorite and the best for noise cancelation. These are comprobable to most over ear headphones.  "

I am overall pleased with this purchase.  Overall sonic presentation is smooth and balanced with just a little bass boost below ~80 Hz.  No serious ""holes"" in the sonic spectrum.  Others have complained about the treble performance, but I find it to be pleasing.  Present enough without becoming over-bearing.  I am a little treble sensitive though to be honest.  Too little is better than too much... and the way these present sounds above ~5k I find to be just about right.  As far as mid-range sounds like vocals and solo instrumentation goes there's just enough boost/energy there to keep things interesting and avoid sounding dull.Be forewarned, despite the low price these are detail revealing enough to reveal poor recordings, and dull sounding source circuits.  Basically a dull, lifeless, flat source or source material will sound exactly that way.  These monitors will not do anything to ""color things up"".  Conversely, well recorded material and a well chosen source will handily reward the listener with an experience well beyond the $55 price.I am very slightly leaning towards the included foam tips the most.  They just feel right for my ears, they seem to block more ambient noise too.  I only wish they included more.  The silicone tips are a little firm feeling in my ear canal, BUT I like how easy they are to insert.  I will probably go back and forth between the various medium size tips.  I haven't completely settled on one strong preference yet.These are just a little on the bulky side for my ears.  I can't comfortably lie/sleep on them.  So as night time ""sleep-cans"" these will be a pass.  I will stick with my cheap JBLs for listening to forest rain and ocean waves while sleeping at night.  "

Pero ten cuidado, primero hay que definir que es un buen sonido .  Si estás acostumbrado a audífonos comerciales o a los audífonos de apple (con cable ) y el sonido de este auricular te va a parecer muy muy distinto . Incluso desagradable.  Este audífono es correcto técnicamente en todo , lo cual podría llegar a ser aburrido para algunas personas .  Imagínate que vas a ver a una orquesta si fónica en vivo . Bueno , este audífono reproduciría los sonidos de esos instrumentos muy fielmente a como se escuchan en vivo , lo cual es lo mejor para personas que buscamos un correcto balance tonal . Pero si tú quieres escuchar ritmos de  moda en donde tu cabeza retumbe con los golpes de los bajos y que tus dientes rechinen con los sonidos de los platillos , definitivamente debes evitar este aparato .  Este es un audífono audiofilo , con un toque de bajo elevado , en donde podrás escuchar los timbres de los instrumentos y las voces de manera cercana a si tuvieras los instrumentos en vivo .

That being said Reds are not 3 times worse that Starfields either, I can easily see someone who prefers bass more than a more balanced sound liking Reds more.Without doubt I can recommend Reds to anyone who are looking to buy an IEM, it's relatively cheap, but on par with 100-200 IEMs (or if you like more bass - probably even better in some cases).

Whether you enjoy music or gaming both sound great on this set. Using high end headphones for years I was surprised at just how good they sound at their current price. Now it is not going to replace a $300 or $400 set of headphones for music although they are not too far off. Currently at this price point however they are excellent and they can easily match in my opinion headphones costing three or four times more. Definitely worth picking up and trying for yourself.  "

Las frecuencias bajas golpean muy bien y los medios se sienten naturales, como si escucharas al artista cantar al lado del micrófono. No conozco ningún otro IEM o audífono que suene así de bien por el precio. Si eres un cliente de marcas conocidas y populares como Samsung, Apple, Beats, Bose, Sonos, etc. Por favor date la oportunidad de probar esta maravilla. Hay una carrera entre los desarrolladores de audiofilia por conseguir el IEM con mejor desempeño por el menor precio y truthear lo está logrando.

Sound is crystal clear and well balanced, treble is crisp without sounding tinny, and the bass punches HARD for an IEM. For the first couple of days I almost questioned if the bass was too much, but I just wasn't used to it - now that I've had them for a couple weeks they sound just right to me. Included tips are very comfortable, but did start to itch after an hour or two - added on a pair of SpinFit CP145s and now I could wear them all day.Separable cord is a great idea and means I don't have to worry about a damaged cable ruining them - though I will say the included cord seems a little flimsy, though it clearly carries the sound just fine, with next to no cable noise from moving it. It does tangle easily, especially with the ""ear hooks"", but that's hard to avoid even with a high quality cable.  "

I wanted something ""more"" than my Chu II's and didn't want to spend over $100. I tried 10 different IEMs under this price point and these blow all of them away, and it's not close.The ones I tested included the KZ ZS10, SIMGOT EW200, TANGZU Wan'er, Yinyoo Melody, Sennheiser IE200, Shure SE215 PRO, BASN Bmaster and more. Some of these cost more, some less than these Truthear x Crinacle Reds and I genuinely couldn't tell the difference between them until I put in these ones.Sure, they have different tuning, different specs and shapes. However, these are all around far and above all of the competition. For $50 these are simply insane. The only other IEM I would remotely consider ""over"" these would be the Moondrop Aria, and those are $25 more, so IMO not worth it. They're just more comfortable to me, but not enough to justify paying that much more. Truthear Hexa's are also great, but they're $80 as well.These are my undisputed value/performance kings. The only gripe I have is they aren't SUPER comfortable, but they aren't uncomfortable either. There is room for improvement in that aspect, but for the punch these pack, I absolutely don't mind that they aren't 10/10 in EVERY category.  "

Importante, probar varias medidas de las siliconas para lograr el equilibrio entre quedar aislado del mundo y tener buen sonido. En cuanto a los bajos, me parecen lo justo. No hace falta reventarse los oídos para apreciar los tonos graves. Entiendo que son unos IEMs de entrada, pero quedé muy satisfecho.

The bass is also beautifully tuned. You get enough boominess to feel it without it bleeding into the mids or distorting. The mid range is clean, although female vocals do sound slightly recessed compared to male vocals, but this is a minor and insignificant gripe. Treble extension, once again, is remarkably good for a two DD and the overall resolution was great in that it was unexpected, but don't plan buy these if you prefer something more technical with lifeline separation. If you're not doing critical listening, this is a fun pair that isn't fatiguing in the slightest. They are a joy to listen to and have become one of my favorite pairs of IEMs.  "
