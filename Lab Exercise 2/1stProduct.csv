"1","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite  ","So comfortable with great sound","Elizabeth Richardson","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 8 March 2024","4.6 out of 5 stars","        They fit nicely in my ears. The best earbuds I've had so far.  The only drawback is that the battery does not last very long. It will last for approximately 3 to 4 hours. To be able to use it for longer, I just use one earbud at a time and switch to the other when the battery runs low.  "

"30","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite  ","Amazing buds","Melanie","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 21 August 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        Amazing sound quality, very convenient and robust touch features, and impressive noise cancelling and ambient sound modes.I had been concerned about purchasing this item based on a number of negative reviews related to the noise cancelling and sound quality, but I now understand that such reviews are most likely from ocd types with a superficial grasp on the topics of signal processing and electronic hardware.If you want absolute isolation to outside noise interference, opt for industrial grade ear plugs; noise cancellation is not a magic panacea.Moreover, for the physical size and price of these earbuds, the sound quality is quite impressive. You'd likely require in excess of several thousands of dollars for custom headphones if you're looking for studio quality sound.  "

"35","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite  ","Comfort?","Krystal","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 31 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        If you're on the fence between these and Airpods, Bose QC, Sony xm4s, this beats them all in terms of sound quality. Incredible value for money especially on sale for $209. The only thing I would point out is that they can struggle to stay in your ear if you have weirdly shaped ear canals like me. I solved this by putting O rings on nozzle below the silicone tips.  "

"38","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite  ","So comfortable with great sound","Elizabeth Richardson","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 17 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        So I'm a music fan, and I've tried many different headphones and buds over the years.  My last pair were the Jabra Elite 7, which is fantastic, I've since lost them, and the lack of a find me feature is a pain.  So I bought the Samsung Buds.  Ok,  sound quality 9/10, ANC 8/10, ambient mode 10/10, build quality 10/10The ambient mode is impressive; I can hear better with the buds in, especially if you turn on the boost mode.All in all, they're pretty good.
