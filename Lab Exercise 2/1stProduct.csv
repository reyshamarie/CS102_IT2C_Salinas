"2","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite  ","Kenma","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 17 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I had been using a cheap pair of buds that I bought from Amazon and thought they were excellent. For my birthday I decided to updates to the Galaxy Buds to pair with my new Galaxy Phone. I was amazed at how much better they were than my old ones and especially love that the battery lasts a long time and also that the app provides me with so many options for customisation. Excrement happy.  "

"25","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite  ","Steven","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 8 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        The delivery time and all the product is ok  "
"26","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite  ","Elizabeth Richardson","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 17 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Amazing sound quality, very convenient and robust touch features, and impressive noise cancelling and ambient sound modes.I had been concerned about purchasing this item based on a number of negative reviews related to the noise cancelling and sound quality, but I now understand that such reviews are most likely from ocd types with a superficial grasp on the topics of signal processing and electronic hardware.If you want absolute isolation to outside noise interference, opt for industrial grade ear plugs; noise cancellation is not a magic panacea.Moreover, for the physical size and price of these earbuds, the sound quality is quite impressive. You'd likely require in excess of several thousands of dollars for custom headphones if you're looking for studio quality sound.  "
"27","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite  ","Kenma","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 21 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Best buds so far, great fit, easy to use, definitely recommend  "

"31","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite  ","Krystal","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 31 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        If you're on the fence between these and Airpods, Bose QC, Sony xm4s, this beats them all in terms of sound quality. Incredible value for money especially on sale for $209. The only thing I would point out is that they can struggle to stay in your ear if you have weirdly shaped ear canals like me. I solved this by putting O rings on nozzle below the silicone tips.  "

"34","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite  ","Joshua Michael","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 22 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        So I'm a music fan, and I've tried many different headphones and buds over the years.  My last pair were the Jabra Elite 7, which is fantastic, I've since lost them, and the lack of a find me feature is a pain.  So I bought the Samsung Buds.  Ok,  sound quality 9/10, ANC 8/10, ambient mode 10/10, build quality 10/10The ambient mode is impressive; I can hear better with the buds in, especially if you turn on the boost mode.All in all, they're pretty good.

"37","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite  ","Baba","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 8 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Love the colour. Nice and compact. Comfortable to wear. Audio is very clear. Great to be able to talk on the phone hands free. Would not go back to earphones with a lead that plugs in. Really happy with these ear buds, they connect seamlessly with my Samsung phone.  "
"38","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite  ","Baba","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 17 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Absolutely love these eat buds.So much so that I bought my wife a pair and she also loves them.I personally use them mostly for extended phone calls mostly (one was a 5 hour business call) but when I have used them for music while walking, the volume and bass is great.They're comfortable to wear for extended periods and easy to forget that they're in when you have the ambient setting on.My wife uses them for Netflix and YouTube while she's cooking or doing stuff around the house.Highly recommend  "
