"1","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","Sam B","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 31 January 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars","        Value for money is insane with these. Bought for mainly podcast and music and prefer the sound profile over my air pod pros.Tried with gaming, and if you plan to play anything with guns and shooting I think these are a little harsh and fatiguing. I would suggest spending within the $150-$300aud area if games are your main focus.On a side note, the build quality for this price range is kind of mind boggling.  "

Estos IEMs presentan una claridad y precisión a la que no tienen derecho por el precio que tienen. Vienen avalados por Crinacle, que para los que no seáis del mundo del audio, viene a ser el referente en análisis de este tipo de auriculares.Lo que sí me ha sorprendido, es ver una reseña que a la vez usa la palabra sibilancia y dice que el sonido es sucio y sin graves. Amigo, sácate la cera de los oídos.Por el precio que tienen, son compra recomendadísima. Eso sí, a tener en cuenta que aislan bastante del sonido exterior, si quieres algo más abierto, no son para ti.    "
"8","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","Kike","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 13 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I daily drive the original zeros at work, and picked this up as replacements for a set i use offsite.  The standard zeroes have excellent audio quality, great comfort, remain in-ear at all times (due to the quite comfortable over the ear hook), and were absurd value for the price.The Zero:2's are all of that still, but they somehow managed to improve the audio quality more.  It's not like the Zeroes are bad by any means, I mean I'm writing this as I have the originals on my head right now.  What I can say though is that you will not be disappointed if you purchase these either as a fresh purchase or upgrades from your existing set.And then there's the price.  I purchased these for roughly $20 USD.  Normally for that price in stores, you'll end up with a pair of earbuds that will stop working in six months.  I have been using the original Zeroes for a year now and have yet to have any hiccups at all with them.The one downside is the cord length.  It is well constructed and highly durable, but it is also on the shorter side.  I use my headphones to go from my desktop mounted workstation to my head.  It's not that far of a distance, maybe 2ft tops.  The length of the cord is roughly 3ft, so that's not bad for most users, and if you're just going from a laptop, handheld, or mobile it's going to be fine.  However if you do have a bit of a longer run, you may want to pick up a headphone extension cable along with this.  "

"10","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","Kurt Ellzey","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Tout d'abord, ce qui ne va pas : les oreillettes en silicone (rouges) pré-installées sont trop petites pour moi. Et les autres oreillettes fournies sont... plus petites. Donc, direction ma réserve d'oreillettes en mousse de chez Klim (diamètre 4,9mm).Une fois tout en place, j'ai un son comme je l'aime : clair sans être criard, précis, des graves honorables mais pas baveux : un pur bonheur, à tarif doux. Et je ne l'ai pas encore rôdé !D'aucuns prétendent qu'il faut s'empresser de changer de câble : peut-être. Pour l'instant, celui d'origine me convient, bien que trop court. J'essaierai sans doute plus tard, par curiosité.Bref, vous l'aurez compris, je recommande vivement ce casque intra AVEC des embouts en mousse adaptés. Je ne peux pas parler du rendu avec les embouts d'origine et d'un embout à l'autre, le son peut beaucoup changer sur des intras.    "
"11","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","TJ","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Sweden on 23 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Nice sound for the price, detailed and natural timbre with solid bass and no treble spike. I'd call it a warm and dark sound signature, which is good for me. Slightly short and wide nozzle. Fits fine, no discomfort. Cable isn't great, it is a bit stiff and thin and cheap feeling, would suggest swapping this out.Similar sound signature to the Hola, but a bit more natural and detailed through the mids and a touch less sheen in the highs. Much worse cable (the Hola cable is excellent) and slightly worse fit than the Hola.Very different sound from the original Salnotes Zero which has a much leaner & brighter sound with less bass and a rough treble spike.

"12","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","Karlito","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in France on 23 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        The headphones sound quite good for the price and come with a lot of size options for the earpiece. These are my first IEMs (I’m also a regular AirPods Pro first generation user) and the in my opinion these sound clearer than the AirPods for a tenth of the price. The chord quality seems a bit cheap, but they have to cut the price somewhere, so it was expectable. Definitely recommend them.  "

A questo prezzo sono da prendere assolutamente in considerazione, sto usando più loro che non le mie Hifiman Sundara, non che siano migliori, ma permettono comunque un ascolto Hi Fi di tutto rispetto.

"15","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","Vasco R. ","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 7 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Alles in allem bin ich sehr zufrieden mit der Klangqualität der In Ears, ich benutze sie zum Zocken von Taktikshootern (CS2/ Rainbow Six Siege), bei denen guter und präziser Sound sehr wichtig ist. Sitz ist gut, optisch gut, Sound gut, also an sich würde ich hier 5 Sterne geben, jedoch ist das Kabel (wo man nun wirklich nicht dran sparen müsste) relativ kurz. Da man bei dieser art von Kopfhöpfhörern die Kabel noch zusätzlich hinterm Kopf längsführt ist das besonders ungünstig.  Man muss daher sehr dicht am PC sitzen damit es passt, zwischendurch ein wenig zurücklehnen ist auch kaum möglich. Daher sollte man hier ein Verlängerungskabel nehmen wenn man nicht gerade direkt am Laptop arbeitet. 20-30cm mehr Kabelhätten hier das Leben aber deutlich vereinfacht...    "
"16","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","gianfranco","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Spain on 10 March 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars","        If you want to talk about sound, these guys got it. Very nice to listen to music on the way home from work.It’s light as well, so that it doesn’t feel like you’ve got weights in your ears (my previous IEM is the KZ ZSN Pro X).On the default ear bud size, it didn’t fit my ear, but thanks to the additional bud sizes, it actually fits!A few drawbacks: when I was trying to use my Fiio BTR5 to make calls with someone, it didn’t work. I couldn’t hear the other person in the other line. Had to switch to putting my phone to my ear.Also, while I’m listening to music on the bus, sometimes it picks up the rumbling in the bus.Cable feels cheap, like it could snap at any time.Otherwise, pretty good value.

"17","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","Rick","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Italy on 4 February 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","        These IEMs are simply the best value I've gotten out of $25, compared to all the other earphones I've tried in my life. However, their size and shape are not for everyone.The drivers have a lot of power and very little distortion across the entire range. The bass is clear and well-balanced, complementing the type of mixes found in most electronic and jazz music. The mids are extremely well-polished and do not sound too washed out or too noisy. Finally, the highs are especially crystal-clear while not being too ringy. Overall, these IEMs have helped me get better mixes on the [electronic] tracks I produce.As for the fit, it is excellent, but only for medium to big ear sizes. I have average-sized ears, and these fit perfectly and do not cause any fatigue or long-term pain. However, for my sister whose ears are much smaller than mine, the ear tips barely make it halfway due to the drivers' housing being too large to fit in her ears. I'd say this is also due to them being in this ""iceberg"" shape. I'm sure that the size and shape of the housing has a small amount to do with the sound characteristics, but I feel like something still could have been done for the ergonomics of these IEMs.Finally, the cable is very nice. Certainly much better than all other cables I've experienced on both headphones and earphones. They flow very well and don't tangle so easily, even if I crumple them up or leave them in my pocket. Whenever they do tangle, however, the ability for the cable to detach from the drivers helps immensely in the process of untangling. The small bead that limits the two sides' separation is not too loose and not too tight; I've found myself using it more often than those on other earphones.The only other thing I can say - these being the first cable-over-the-ear IEMs I've used - is that there is certainly a learning curve to determining which side is which and exactly how to put them on. This made for an interesting experience when I first tried to share one side with my siblings.All-in-all, I would strongly recommend this if you want powerful, lush, and balanced-sounding earphones for a very good price, unless your ears are on the smaller side.

YMMV.The sound profile like others said is dark but I found it too muddy, bass didn't have good separation or response. Cable is rather short as well.For similar money I bought the Lingsoul Tangzu, and they fit a lot better, and sounded a lot better.  "
"22","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","Yagz","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Spain on 12 March 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","      Vorab: Schlussteil bitte beachten ;-)Ich vergleiche mal die genannten IEMs, da beide soweit ich weiß relativ zeitnah auf den Markt kamen und ich ungefähr den selben Preis bezahlt habe.Die Zero 2 gabs für 22 statt 26€:Gehäuse sind aus Kunststoff, die Anschlüsse für die 2-Pin Stecker sind in einem leicht unterschiedlichen Winkel ins Gehäuse geklebt worden und die ""Düsen"" kann man nicht entfernen, wenn einem irgendwann die feinen Filter verdrecken hat man keinen Spaß. Das erweckt beides schonmal keinen guten Eindruck.Das Kabel ist richtig mies, es verknotet sich extrem leicht, riecht dezent nach Gummiboot und mir juckte es nach kürzester Zeit hinter den Ohren.Das selbe gilt für die Tips, zum ersten mal finde ich keine wirklich für mich geeigneten Spitzen in der Box. Diejenigen die ideal passen ohne zu schmerzen klingen für mich am schlechtesten, die mit dem besseren Klang schmerzen und fangen auch nach ein paar Lieder auch an zu jucken. Unterschiedliche Durchmesser der Öffnungen, aber eben nicht so das für jede Größe der selbe Durchmesser vorliegen würde, obendrein völlig unterschiedliche Härtegrade des Materials, planlos zusammengeworfener Müll in meinen Augen...oder Ohren. Das kenne ich so garnicht...und ich hatte schon einige chinesische Earbuds.Zum Klang: getestet mit passenden beiliegenden Spitzen verschiedener Öffnungsdurchmesser, einmal mit Originalkabel und dann mit Tripowin Zonie an einem F.Audio KS01. Klingen nach meinem Geschmack gut, wenn ich auch hier und da mal kurz den Eindruck hatte da ""scheppert"" was, sie werden einen Platz bei mir finden...mit Spitzen und Kabel von einem anderen günstigen IEM...das Zeug was beiliegt ist wirklich für die Tonne...Preis/Leistung wird dadurch merklich geschmälert. Bin enttäuscht das Crinacle seinen Namen in Kombination mit solchem Lieferumfang hergibt abgesehn von den Mankos des Gehäuses.Reudig und ZWINGT zum Ersatz, hätte ich keine Ersatzteile da könnte ich damit nicht anfangen. Schade.Kurz der Vergleich zu den Moondrop Chu 2: diese haben 19 gekostet, 7euro weniger als der reguläre Preis der hier bei Amazon aufgerufen wird. Sie kommen mit einer kleinen Soft-Pouch, einem deutlich weniger labbrigen Kabel (das obendrein geruchsneutral ist und keine Hautreaktionen verursacht) und wie gewohnt mindestens einem paar Spitzen kommt das perfekt sitzt. Die Düsen des Metall-Body lassen sich abschrauben, die Filter somit tauschen/reinigen etc. Klang: natürlich anders, aber auch gut. Das hängt von vielen Faktoren ab und ist zudem auch etwas subjektiv. Preis/Leistung ist bei den Chu 2 aber eben etliche male höher...damit fährt man sicherlich besser wenn einem der Klang gefällt.Daher im Billo-Bereich, klangunabhängig: 3 Sterne für die Zero 2 und 5 für die Chu 2. Wenn ihr euch für diese IEMs noch ein Kabel kaufen müsstet, noch kein Case und keine anderen Spitzen rumliegen habt...spart euch das Geld und kauft direkt etwas anderes das mit brauchbarem ""Zubehör"" kommt. Für nen guten Fuffi zB Truthear Zero Red    "
"23","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","Leberwurstbr0t","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Spain on 29 January 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","        Watched Crinacle whilst starting out getting a digital audio player. Bought a set of Zero 2 to see what what they would be like versus the CCZ Warrior IEMs I initially purchased here on Amazon for around the same price.As a comparison to the CCZ Warrior's my comments as follows.Zero2 first impressions are that they look cheap. The cable looks like an immediate replacement required. Good initial selection of coloured tips. Digital Audio Player sound level lower so more volume required (CCZ Melody has lower impedance). Where's the Bass!? I heard they had an enhanced bass but it is lower than the Melody's.My personal preference after a few hours listening to my music through each is that for the similar pricing I'd pick the Yinyoo CCZ Melody IEM based on performance, standard of build, cable supplied and looks/finish.I shall keep the Zero 2 for back-up, maybe buy a better longer cable and use them on the PC for gaming.

"24","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","Richard","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 15 February 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","        2/27/24I just got these the other day.I am not an audiophile but I trust Crinacle's opinion. These IEMs sound good to me and I don't hear a real difference between them and the Linsoul KZ ZS10 Pro IEMs I've had for a few months. To be honest I do not like these as much.This product is cheaper than my other set The ZS10s by anywhere between 15 and 25 USD. That money value for the sound is in favor of the Zero:2's but the other features of the IEMs suffer because of the price. The cable in this is a very standard cable similar to the Iphone wired earbuds But I find the cable to be a bit short. The part that wraps around your ear is fine but on my other set of IEMs the cover that is there is of higher quality.I can see myself exchanging the cable in the future but that adds to the cost of buying these in my opinion. I would steer someone to the ZS10s instead and look out for the limited-time deals that are offered on them instead if you are looking for money value.  "

"26","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","Benjamin Pinkerton","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 19 January 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","      Hatte vorher Tunai Drums, die ein kleines bisschen teurer waren und auch ein kleines bisschen besser in den Mitten und ich denke minimal besser im tiefen Bereich abschnitten.Das Problem sind mal wieder die Stöpsel.Wenn keiner passt, dann hilft einem auch nicht die reichliche Auswahl die mitgeliefert wird.Nicht nur passen die mitgelieferten nicht, diese Art des raueren Silikon sorgt zusätzlich bei mir noch für unangenehme Hautreaktionen in den Ohren.Ist frustrierend wenn man gezwungen ist zusätzlich Geld für andere Stöpsel auszugeben und da dann noch was zu finden was für die eigenen Ohren passt.Qualitative Stöpsel kosten gar nicht mal so wenig und trotzdem muss man erstmal testen ob sie überhaupt passen und ich vermute einfach mal dass es aus hygienischen Gründen nicht möglich ist sie im Fall der Fälle wieder zu retournieren.Jetzt im Nachhinein betrachtet hätte ich wahrscheinlich in meinem Fall eher Kopfhörer einer Preisklasse drüber kaufen sollen.

"28","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","kevin","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 4 March 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars","        I received a pair of these IEMs a few days ago and was initially quite pleased with the sound. They have a nice, boomy sound for gaming, while also reproducing the higher end of the spectrum well. However, I encountered a few drawbacks. Firstly, the right-side IEM lost about 80% of its volume after I put them in my ears, and even cleaning the filter didn't fix the issue. This happened despite only using them for a few sessions. Secondly, the midrange spectrum would crackle when talking with friends on Discord, even at low volume (around 30%).Despite these issues, when they were working properly, they did sound good for games. If you manage to get a pair without these problems and primarily use them for gaming, I would recommend them for the price.  "

"49","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ",NA,NA,NA,NA,"        It's hard to think of anything positive about these headphones except that the earpieces look cool and there are lots of swappable colour choices. I started to get a bad feeling when it was so difficult to get them out of the box. It deepened when I had to play hide and seek between Chinese text to find the English instructions. Shouldn't have worried because there wasn't anything essential. I now know that the magnets in them can affect pacemakers though.Personally, I like wired headphones without a mic. When I don a set to listen to music, I never get the urge to answer a call. There's a single set of proprietary cables with a standard 3.5mm 3 conductor plug at the end. Although the earpieces are marked L and R, I couldn't find corresponding markings on the incredibly tiny connectors for each headphone element. The pins in them are about as slender as a sewing needle. It took unusual pressure to lock them in place on the elements themselves. If you break or lose this cable, you'll not be able to go to a big box store to pick up a replacement. They are unique and proprietary.I could not get them to stay in my ears without considerable effort. They kept popping out. I noticed that some of the spare rubber covers appeared to be larger than what it came with. I had so much trouble putting a new one on, I gave up. Oh yeah, then there's the sound quality of these headphones. I listened to orchestral classical, choral, pop and hard rock. No obvious lower register at all and a truncated high end too. Tinny and indistinct pretty much covers it.A genuinely awful set of headphones. Not recommended at all.  "
