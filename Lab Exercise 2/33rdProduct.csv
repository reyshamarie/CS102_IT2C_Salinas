It sounds so much better and realistic.The sound on these is stellar. I was half expecting an extremely v-shaped tuning going into these, but knowing that these only equip a 6mm driver I had a slight feeling that they would actually have a more neutral default tuning. It seems as though my feelings were right- for the most part. The default tuning doesn't have much lower-mids and therefore sounds somewhat hollow, but with some tuning that can be fixed. Using the app I have bumped the 160hz slider halfway up along the band, the 400hz slider halfway up between the 160hz slider and the top of the band, the 1khz slider a couple notches lower than the 400hz slider, the 2.5khz a couple notches higher than the 400hz slider, and lastly the 6.25khz slider a tiny bit lower than the 1khz slider. This sound might not be for everyone, but it suits the music I tend to listen to most often, that being classical,jazz, and some rock. The sound with these settings is crisp, full and extremely comfortable, and by that I mean you get none of that ear-piercingly loud 10khz+ that a lot of earbuds have that is sometimes not capable of being done away with.In terms of design, I think these look absolutely beautiful. While it is very clear from size and shape comparisons that these are highly influenced by the airpods, that doesn't get rid of how amazing the case feels and looks and how amazing the individual earbuds look. Additionally, the earbuds are extremely comfortable in the ears.Now, when it comes to features, that's where these begin to fall down the tier list. The anc and transparency mode are not bad, but for the price bracket I believe that the anc and transparency could be improved. Touch controls are very responsive and accurate, but the customization is restricted to pressing and holding the earbuds, which by default switched between the sound modes.Lastly, some extra points I'd like to make are that 1) the sound separation+soundstage is very impressive, and 2) the battery is amazing; the battery on a single charge of the earbuds lasts 6hrs with anc ON and possibly 9 HOURS with it off.If the anc and transparency were better I probably would have given these 5 stars, but for the price, I believe that 4.45 stars is adequate.I highly recommend these to those into music with lots of instruments and vocals, like jazz or rock, but I probably wouldn't recommend these to bass heads.

These are the earbuds I've been waiting for. I've been using Jabra ones for last few years and I was ready to switch or upgrade. These earbuds working straight out of the box, can connect them via bluetooth with my laptop without any additional software and these working as a headset for online meetings and conference calls. But to unleash the full potential I recommend to download the app on the phone (its compatible with iOS and Android) and set up the 'classic' Marshall sound, which goes fab with the rock music.Earbuds are touch sensitive, so pause, skip to next or pick up incoming call is easy with a few taps. The most fancy thing is a noise cancelling, which can be adjusted to personal needs (may completely isolate from the environment) and may set it to full transparency, where all the noises from the outside are amplified. I also love the design, the box and the usb charging cable looking like being taken from the Marshall guitar amp! I'm positively impressed with these and I'm happy to recommend it!  "

The box is a lovely small rectangular shape fits lovely into my handbag or work bag. The charge of both the buds and the case is amazing lasts up to 80 hrs. Now the sound well what can I say it's lovely such good quality for soft music or loud beats music, the pitch is just great on them and the noise cancellation works a treat can not hear anything else going on around you.

I am not sure of course if this is just because of the particular shape of my ears, or whether they are particularly clever design, but for me this is a key point as I hate going out with earbuds feeling that one might drop out at any moment.They are also nice earbuds. The specs are fine: 6 hours playtime with ANC (active noise cancellation) engaged, wireless charging, IPX 5 water resistance (plenty good enough for rain), and transparency mode for hearing what is going on around you. On the Bluetooth side, there is support for LBC (Low Complexity Communications Codec) which is more efficient and higher quality than the old SBC protocol.The earbuds support tap controls which I do not much like in general as they are fiddly and prone to mis-taps. You can disable them though, via an app for iOS or Android. You can also customise them to a degree. I have mine set so the left earbud turns the volume down with a long press, and the right one turns it up. You can also set them for ANC control, EQ, or voice assistant, but with just two earbuds, you have to choose.Most important, how about the sound? In general, very good. The sound is balanced, neither excessive in the bass nor the treble. It perhaps lacks the last degree of refinement you can get from high-end earbuds, but is consistently enjoyable.These Marshall earbuds make an excellent pragmatic choice, with good sound, good features, and a very secure fit.

Meine Erwartungen waren hoch undwurden nicht enttäuscht.Das Design ist außergewöhnlich - im positivem Sinne. Das gilt auch für das La-decase. Es ist wohl keinen Millimeter größer, als es sein müsste. Das Case schütztdie Kopfhörer bei Nichtgebrauch und lädt diese gleichzeitig über magnetischeKontakte auf.Die Soundqualität ist bereits in der Standardeinstellung sehr gut und klar. Fallsdas nicht genügt, kann man zwischen verschiedene Soundprofilen in der Appwählen. Ich nutze darin gerne die Bassanhebung.Zusätzlich kann das Active Noise-Canceling aktiviert und sogar individuell an-gepasst werden. Die Wirkung ist beeindruckend. Mit diesen Ohrhörern habe ichdas erste Mal bei In-Ear-Höhrern eine tatsächliche Unterdrückung der Umge-bungsgeräusche wahrnehmen können. Es ist auch ein transparenter Modusverfügbar, der praktisch das Gegenteil darstellt. Umgebungsgeräusche werdendamit über die integrierten Mikrofone verstärkt.Die kleinen Akkus in den Ohrstöpseln halten etwa 7 Stunden und können imgeladenen Case etwa 3 mal neu aufgeladen werden.Das Case lädt man per USB-C. Ein entsprechendes Kabel befindet sich im Lie-ferumfang. Dort findet man auch Ersatzstöpsel in verschiedenen Größen.Die Verbindung zum Abspielgerät erfolgt per Bluetooth. Die erste Kopplunghat innerhalb weniger Sekunden funktioniert.Um herauszufinden, welche Funktionen die Höhrer an beiden Seiten haben, mussman auf jeden Fall einen Blick in die Anleitung werfen oder die Konfiguration inder App aufrufen. Hier kann man die Belegung auch ändern.Es können auch direkte Verknüpfungen mit Spachassistenten oder Musik-Streaming-diensten wie Spotify hergestellt werden. Das habe ich bisher aber nicht gebraucht.Ich kann die Kopfhörer wärmstens empfehlen. Die Qualität und Haptik aller Teileist beeindruckend. Mehr brauche ich jedenfalls nicht. Auch die Verarbeitung undder Funktionsumfang sind umwerfend. 5 Sterne, keine Frage.    "

Die Ladeschale ist im typischen Marshal-Finish gestaltet, was sich für Rock-Musik-Fans wirklich toll anfühlt und auch sehr stylisch aussieht. Die Ohrstecker selbst erinnern am unteren Ende an den Drehregler eines Marshall-Verstärkers, außerdem ziert sie ein ""M"" im Marshall-Design. Neben einer Anleitung finden sich noch ein Paar kleinere und ein Paar größere Silikonaufsätze, ein obligatorisches Ladekabel sowie die Bedienungsanleitung im Lieferumfang. Für meine kleinen Gehörgänge sind die kleinsten Aufsätze gerade richtig.Nach der ersten Kopplung mit einem Mobilgerät muss die passende App aus dem App-Store geladen und installiert werden. Das klappte bei meinen iPhone SE (3. Generation) ohne Probleme in Sekundenschnelle. Eine Registrierung ist im Unterschied zu anderen Herstellern nicht nötigt und soweit ich es sehen konnte auch nicht vorgesehen. Meine Motif II waren innerhalb weniger Minuten komplett einsatzbereit.Der Klang der InEar-Kopfhörer erinnert tatsächlich an den typischen Marshall-Sound: laut, breit und ziemlich aufdringlich. Die einstellbare Lautstärke ist hoch und sollte vermutlich mit Vorsicht nach oben geregelt werden. Nachvollziehbar, aber nicht wirklich ""analog"", werden die Ohrhörer über eine typische Touchsteuerung bedient. Eine manuelle Steuerung (vielleicht sogar in den angedeuteten Drehreglern an der Hörerunterseite) gibt es leider nicht. Das ANC ist sehr gut nachvollziehbar und arbeitet effektiv, Telefonanrufe lassen sich direkt an den Ohrsteckern annehmen und bieten einen glasklaren Ton, auch wenn man sich einige Meter von Mobiltelefon entfernt.Zusammengefasst bewerte ich die Marshall Motif II ANC mit herzlichen fünf von fünf möglichen Sternen. Die Kopfhörer sind makellos verarbeitet, das verwendete Material wirkt sehr hochwertig. Die Inbetriebnahme klappt reibungslos innerhalb weniger Minuten, die zugehörige App benötigt keinerlei Registrierung oder Anmeldung. Was aber das wichtigste ist: Der Sound ist laut und knackig, genau so wie ich es von einem Marshall-Produkt erwarten würde.    "

Bis Dato habe ich die weißen vom großen A verwendet. Hauptsächlich für das  telefonieren und Musik hören.Die Motif II haben mich voll und ganz überzeugt und lösen die weißen ab. Der Klang ist wirklich sehr schön und hinzukommt der Tragekomfort. Auch nach langem tragen stören die überhaupt nicht. Sitzen gut und fest. Die Sprachqualität ist gut. Bei meinen Gesprächspartner komme ich deutlich rüber.Die Verbindung via Bluetooth funktioniert einwandfrei. Die Verbindung ist stabil.Mitgeliefert werden 3 Silikon-Adapter für das Ohr. Ich denke für jeden etwas dabei.Die Funktionen an den Hörern selber funktionieren gut. Die Reaktion ist zufriedenstellend.ANC funktioniert gut. Könnte nach meinem Empfinden etwas besser sein. Das Design ist wirklich TOP. Erinnert so an die Drehregler von Marshall-Verstärkern.Das Design ist typisch für Marshall.Im Großen und Ganzen sehr gute Kopfhörer mit guter Preisleistung.    "
