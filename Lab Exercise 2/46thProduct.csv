"1","Samsung EO-EG920BW White Genuine Headset/Handsfree/Headphone/Earphone with Volume Control for Galaxy Phones (Non Retail Packaging - Bulk Packaging)  ","Mark","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 29 January 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars","        Good and clear sound, reasonable bass for the price. Good selection of silicone sizes for a nice fit. Not 100% noise cancellation. Still some background noise if you have the volume at low ot medium. App does allow you different sound options to customise the earbuds.The button/touch options are a bit sensitive for pause and skipping. They work too wellOverall a good item. Works well at the gym for sound and background noise.  "

Helps to have music you can hear and sway to. :) Comfy, long lasting charge on buds and case, rich sound, easy to pair. Very happy with my purchase!  "
"3","Samsung EO-EG920BW White Genuine Headset/Handsfree/Headphone/Earphone with Volume Control for Galaxy Phones (Non Retail Packaging - Bulk Packaging)  ","Mark","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 29 January 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars","        I purchased the Anker Soundcore Life P3  for some long flights I was about to do, and I wanted the noise-canceling features, they performed amazingly well. I have used them for both movies and music, and the base is better than any earbuds I have used. The touch functions on the sides weren't great, and a bit slow, but to be honest I tend to use the device for stop-pause volume, etc. anyway. The app has multiple noise-canceling settings that work well with a sleep mode that allows you to add wind sea, birds, etc to help you sleep (very cool, I have Bose earbuds with this feature that cost 10x more) The Bluetooth has a very long range and all in all I give these 9 out of 10, I was gifted Beats earbuds for the flight and preferred the Anker Soundcore Life P3 for sound quality and features. They lose one point, not because of the earbuds themselves but because some flights wouldn't allow you to wear earbuds during landing, so I could watch the end of Marvels :(  Very happy.  "
"4","Samsung EO-EG920BW White Genuine Headset/Handsfree/Headphone/Earphone with Volume Control for Galaxy Phones (Non Retail Packaging - Bulk Packaging)  ","Mark","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 5 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Only received these yesterday. So impressed. Connection to my iPhone, iPad and Apple TV was instant. With three different pairs of Apple AirPods, the devices search forever and sometimes still can‚Äôt find the AirPods  without a device reset. Noise cancelling is brilliant. The buds fit comfortably in the ear and don‚Äôt feel like they will fall out. Haven‚Äôt tested the battery life fully yet, but used them to watch movies for five hours without a problem. I was able to leave the room where they were connected to the Apple TV and still hear the sound at the other end of the house. Overall, just in the short time I‚Äôve used the buds, they are brilliant. I got a discount price, but they are worth paying the full price if not discounted. I don‚Äôt write many reviews, but these earbuds are so impressive, I felt I should give my opinion to others who are trying to decide whether to purchase.  "
"5","Samsung EO-EG920BW White Genuine Headset/Handsfree/Headphone/Earphone with Volume Control for Galaxy Phones (Non Retail Packaging - Bulk Packaging)  ","Emily M.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 14 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Don't buy anything else in the market. These sounds way better than anything the likes of Sony and Apple could produce.I originally bought these as a replacement for my Sony LinkBud-S as they suddenly stopped working, however, I'm thinking about making these my permanent/main ones. These earphones have a better ergonomic design, sound superior to anything in the market, and software support/experience for them on the phone is somehow better than Apple's and Sony's.I could continue to write more, and more about how these earphones are way better than anything in the market but I'm too lazy to write more.

I was surprised that not only was the noise cancellation superior, but the sound quality was much better as well.  I used them on an aircraft and pretty well all noise was cancelled. There are multiple noise cancellation configurations, but I‚Äôve found the transport option the most useful as it also blocks car sounds.  For music, the sound is very rich with good base.The buds also stay in my ears very well.  "

I prefer rich bass and dang, it's good!Mic - I could be heard loud and clear by the person on the other line but has only been tested on a quiet environment AFAIC. The only ANC experience I had so far was when my husband was talking to me while I was in my phone watching a video, dead of night and I couldn't hear him! Haha!Battery - don't get to use it that much but I guess battery life has been pretty good.My only gripe is that it gets easily scratched, though it was my fault because I chucked it in a small bag together with a USB cable. Almost indiscernible but makes silly ol' me just a teeny tiny bit sad. Then my screaming toddler tackles me and I forget all about it. üòÇGlad I got this on sale a few weeks ago, a lower price than it was during the Amazon Big Smile sale some few days ago. And delivered on the same day, no less! Amazing Prime! üëçüèª  "

Fit is amazing. Sound is top notch. Distance when using is better then 10m easily!!!! The only downside which is super random is if you are perfectly straight on to the wind they make a small whistle sound.... Could also be the angle of my ears or how I wear them ectNow to see if they last the test of time.  "

The noise cancellation is great for cutting out speech, but you can hear traffic (which I prefer as I'm often wearing these while commuting or walking around). The sound quality and bass are great for the price. A solid investment for general use, listening to podcasts, audiobooks and music while exercising. Battery life is excellent.  "

The sound quality is outstanding and delivers amazing Bass response for their size, the provided software is a real surprise and allows you to fine-tune every aspect of the listening experience.

I use them at the gym, work, at home. Low profile, excellent value, great sound and the noise cancellation feature works really well. Only cons so far: a) not much noise cancellation / isolation in the upper frequency bands. This is something the over-ears are much better at. b) The touch controls can be slightly finicky, but they get them mostly right. Pros far outweigh the cons though.  "
