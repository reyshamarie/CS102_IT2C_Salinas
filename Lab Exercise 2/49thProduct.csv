"1","SoundPEATS Air3 Wireless Earbuds Mini Bluetooth V5.2 Earphones with Qualcomm QCC3040 and aptX-Adaptive, 4-Mic and CVC 8.0 Noise Cancellation, TrueWireless Mirroring Tech, in-Ear Detection, Game Mode  ","Nic B.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 20 February 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars","        I read good things about these in audiophile forums and wasn't disappointed.They have surprisingly good clarity, resolution and instrument separation for the price.Their sound is on the bright side of things, but not fatiguing. It's a shade brighter than neutral. There can be the occasional sharp spike in the high-mids, but not bothersome.But it depends on the person's taste. If you like a warm/dark sounding IEM then these are probably not for you.The bass is tight and lean, it's not woofy or artificial. If you're a bass head then it's probably not going to be enough for you, but if you like ""accurate"" bass then you will like these. The rumble is there, but it takes more of a supportive role than a primary role.The soundstage is accurate. Not overly wide, not overly narrow. You get the punch in the middle while getting a good amount of width. The imaging is good, I can easily pick out where each instrument is coming from.The comfort okay, not bad, not great. I can't wear them for more than 1.5 hrs before I start to wanna take them off. But I've got stiff cartilage in my ears which makes them sensitive to pressure over time, so most ppl should be fine.They are more comfy than my previous Bluetooth IEMs though.I don't love the look of the cable but it's not a deal breaker. Seems to sound good.Build quality is great with the all metal shells. I have no fear of them breaking in my pocket.I'm surprised they are this cheap, they're really good. Don't get me wrong, they're not gonna wow you as much as some great headphones, but their Amazon rating should be higher than 4.4. I bought some Bluetooth earphones for around the same price a few years ago and these are twice as good. These are underrated.Easy to drive too. I have them playing through my phone.  "

I did however change the cable and the tips because I had some laying around. Having a good ear seal is essential if you want get the experience everyone is having with these beauties. Stock, they were impressive but now they are awesome, well for the price that's for sure. You won't need any special audio equipment to make these sound good.I did try a few simple mods to see what could be done with these puppies and I was yet again impressed by one mod that I use on my letshuoer s12s. Instead of describing what I did, just search for ""letshuoer s12 micropore tape"" on YouTube. This gave me more bass and a wider sound stage. Well, to my ears it did, but it might be different for yours but the mod is worth a try :)You can't go wrong with these. Enjoy them!  "

With these you get a substantial improvement in build quality for that single step up the price ladder, with a nice metal shell that I find very comfortable to wear for prolonged periods (I find I enjoy putting them in when they're cold!) and decent quality braided cable. A lot has been written about how these sound, I'd just reiterate that they're on the brighter side than I'm used to, but not at all tiring, there is a richness and clarity with technical detail and a tight and precise bass response that I enjoy. This IEM journey has been a cautious one for me, I'm not ready to spend the sort of money I would on some decent open back headphones. But the Simgot EW200s represent excellent value for money in my opinion.  "

I'm just a casual listener but after trying this one, I can definitely say these are really good. The IEMs itself feel premium with its metal coating. It feels heavy in hand and the sound places the vocals in front of the instruments. The bass is decent, not too bass heavy but it's there. It just sounds great with general music listening (pop) and content watching. Gaming wise I feel like it's better if you get another IEM as the soundstage is not too wide in my opinion, so intricate sounds like footsteps is harder to pinpoint the exact direction. For the price, I thought it's a really good purchase for a daily earphone.  "

So far I am really impressed with the sound and versatility of this set for a large variety of genres. Plentiful bass with a high quality tone, excellent male and female vocals, impactful percussion, well tuned and pleasant highs with good energy but not fatiguing or sibilant. They are comfortable in my ear. They look sharp too but are fingerprint magnets. A wonderful choice in this price range. I got mine for $31 for Black Friday and that is truly insane price for performance. I‚Äôm hooked, these will be my daily drivers / on-the-go set. Try the EW200 you will love them!  "

Su respuesta de frecuencias, mostrada en gr√°fica, es congruente para unos auriculares intraurales, con la t√≠pica ca√≠da en la parte alta del espectro en este tipo de dispositivo, lo que otorga un sonido fiel a la grabaci√≥n. Si alguien prefiere realces en graves, medios o agudos, siempre podr√° acudir a una ecualizaci√≥n b√°sica, pues la buena respuesta de frecuencia de estos auriculares permite cambios audibles con leves ajustes.Por otro lado el tacto de los auriculares muestra una excelente calidad de fabricaci√≥n.No veo la necesidad de gastar m√°s dinero para obtener mejor calidad de sonido en unos auriculares intraurales; ni tampoco una mejor est√©tica, para quien sea sensible a las apariencias.

"19","SoundPEATS Air3 Wireless Earbuds Mini Bluetooth V5.2 Earphones with Qualcomm QCC3040 and aptX-Adaptive, 4-Mic and CVC 8.0 Noise Cancellation, TrueWireless Mirroring Tech, in-Ear Detection, Game Mode  ","Bogatz","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 7 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Zuerst das Negative:Der Frequenzgang gef√§llt mir pers√∂hnlich nicht sonderlich, ich w√ºrde ihn aber nicht schlecht nennen, viele m√∂gen das so. Dadurch, dass es keine krassen peaks oder dips gibt, ist er auch sehr einfach mit EQ zu ver√§ndern. In meinen Ohren sitzen die IEMs leider nicht sehr komfortabel, das wird aber wieder von der Person abh√§ngen.  Was mir negativ am Klang aufgefallen ist, ist, dass er nicht sonderlich nat√ºrlich klingt und es sich manchmal so anh√∂rt, als w√ºrden die Instrumente nicht richtig zusammen funktionieren. Er klingt generell sehr trocken und weniger ""abgeschlossen"", was glaube ich mit der Geschwindigkeit des verwendeten Treibers zusammen h√§ngt.  Die Stimme ist meistens nicht sonderlich fokussiert, sondern steht eher im ganzen Raum, wovon ich kein Fan bin.Damit sind wir beim Positiven: Der IEM ist enorm hochaufl√∂send. So, wie ich es noch nie bei einem IEM geh√∂rt habe, inklusive vielen, die bis zu dem Zehnfachen kosten. Immer wenn ich mit anderen IEMs K√ºnstler wie Bob Dylan oder Faber h√∂re, habe ich das Gef√ºhl die Textur auf der Stimme komme nicht richtig r√ºber, wenn man es mit einem HD600 vergleicht. Das ist nat√ºrlich nicht fair, und ich sage nicht, dass der ew200 ganz da ist, aber ich habe zumindest nie das Gef√ºhl, dass ich etwas verpasse. Die Klarheit und Seperation der einzelnen Details ist auch wirklich enorm gut. Ich habe gestern eine Vorlesung mit dem HD600 geguckt und dann zu dem ew200 gewechselt und mir ist sofort ein ganz eindeutiger Hall im Raum aufgefallen, den ich vorher nicht geh√∂rt hatte. Der Bass ist ohne EQ sehr laut, ich habe ihn 7db runtergestellt, was theoretisch deutlich niedriger ist, als ich normalerweise h√∂re, aber der ""punch"" ist so gut, dass mir das garnicht so vorkommt. Im vergleich zu etwas wie dem 7hz Timeless ist das wirklich Tag und Nacht. Da ist der Bass noch lauter, aber es gibt garkeinen richtigen impact. Sachen wie die Textur auf der Stimme kommen da auch so gut wie garnicht r√ºber. Generell ist Einzige, was der Timeless besser macht das aufger√§umt sein und die Koh√§renz des Klangs. K√∂nnte ich nur einen behalten, w√ºrde ich auf jeden Fall diesen nehmen. Wenn ihr von etwas, wie einem Truthear Hola kommt, ist die Aufl√∂sung eine komplett andere Welt, ich k√∂nnte mir sogar vorstellen, dass sie am Anfang √ºberfordert.    "

It is astonishing you can get something that sounds this amazing for $39Up until now I have avoided IEM because of fitment issues. These are a nice size and quite comfortable. The silicone tips that came with them are not for me. I ordered a variety pack of foam tips and the large ones were just the ticket. I struggled until that point getting a good seal, and was somewhat disappointed with the low end. Once the proper tips for me were put on, now the seal is tight and sounds perfect on the bottom end.If you like a nice clean open sound, with crystal clear mids and highs, with a generally solid bottom end, these are great. The sub frequencies are present and accounted for, just don't slam like some people like.These are exceptionally easy to drive so no extra stuff is needed. a simple usb c dongle is fine.  "

Bin schlichtweg begeistert. Mein Setup sehr ihr ja. Das USB-C zu USB-C Kabel ist ins von ddHifi, gibt's hier auch. Von mir klare Empfehlung !    "

This is 100x better than the Bluetooth jbls I was using before.Bass is wonderful.  They go so low, but are not boomy. highs aren't exhausting.  Mid range is full.  The detail across everything is remarkable.  I'm finding Subtle production/ instrument details I have never heard before.So glad I tried this!  "

The build quality is exceptional. Crome plated metal shells‚Ä¶ the cable is fine.. no issues tangling. Comes with a really nice case that is sensibly sized.The fit. and comfort is par excellent. These iems literally disappear in my ears, Now about the sound. Incredible detail retrieval. The mid bass transition to the the lower mids is done in such a way that really gives this set character. No bleed at all though. The simgot ea500 scales beautifully. It doesn‚Äôt get shouty at all when you crank the volume up.  I am treble sensitive yet this iem set doesn‚Äôt bother me at all in the treble region. I recommend this iem set whole heartedly. It‚Äôs a no brainer.  "
