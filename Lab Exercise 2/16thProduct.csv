"3","Shure SE215 Pro Professional Sound Isolating Earphones (Clear)  ","Prospa","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Spain on 26 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Son los segundos iem que compro. Tuve que devolver antes unos Shanling porque no me ajustaban bien y se hacían incómodos.Estos me resultan comodísimos, incluso tras varias horas de uso, probablemente porque su cable es bastante blando alrededor de las orejas y no molesta.En cuanto al sonido, al principio me pareció que los bajos eran poco contundentes y los agudos un poco agresivos. Tras unas horas de uso (con Amazon Music unlimited), creo que han mejorado muchísimo (o yo me he acostumbrado a su sonido). Los bajos me resultan claros y suficientemente marcados, aunque no son de los que te hacen saltar los empastes. Los agudos me parecen ahora mucho más suaves. Las voces (en especial femeninas) suenan genial.En fin, hoy por hoy, los volvería a comprar (al menos por los 101€ que me han costado).    "

"5","Shure SE215 Pro Professional Sound Isolating Earphones (Clear)  ","Stefano","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 26 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Me encantaron los audífonos, Son Alambricos por si no lo notaron. Se escuchan muy bien!!! Eso si he notado que con el iPhone 15 Pro Max la salida usando un DAC de Ugreen como que no tiene mucha potencia, se escuchan muy bien pero llevando el volumen a lo máximo, por lo contrario, con la salida del jack de una MacBook Pro 14"" e iMac M1, la potencia es muy alta, con un 80% de volumen es mas que suficiente. Supongo que esta diferencia es por el DAC. Por ello ya compré el DAC iFi GO Link esperemos la potencia mejore. Otra situación son las almohadillas de silicona para orejas estas son muy comodas pero para mis orejas se sienten pequeñas y eso que estoy usando las almohadillas granes (L) por ello es que compre unas talla XL, pero esto es muy particular. Recomiendo ampliamente los audífonos para escuchar música en todo su esplendor, por cierto los bajos no son tan potentes, pero OJO Bajos potentes NO significa que este mal, por el contrario hace que los medios y agudos se escuchen muy bien. Recuerden que son audífonos para Audiófilos. 100% Recomendables.    "

"7","Shure SE215 Pro Professional Sound Isolating Earphones (Clear)  ","Yo","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        These are one of the single best IEM's money can buy. They're just so overwhelmingly competent. Great detail. Great balanced bass. an OUTSTANDING soundstage and instrument separation, excellent imaging, not too hard to drive. Energetic and musical without being unnatural or V shaped. pretty universal shape that's comfortable in probably everyone's ears. The cable is fantastic and light. They're easy enough to drive that you don't need any special equipment.They're just outrageously versatile. Every genre I throw at them they just gobble up. Gaming? the soundstage and imaging are outstanding. Movies and lectures? dialogue doesn't get buried. The EM6L are a bit more natural in the mids, but these throw down on accuracy. They're fun without losing focus on technical competence.If I had to pick some complaints, I'd point out that the QDC connector is not the best. I had one wiggle a HAIR loose in a few weeks of just throwing them in my backpack and it was causing the right IEM to short. Linsoul just told me to return it on amazon and the process was easy enough, and I would never argue a single QC issue is indicative of anything more than an anecdote. The replacement pair has been rock solid.They're also fingerprint magnets. Piano black was a stupid idea. You touch them every time you put them in or take them out.  And the nozzles have no flange, so a few different kinds of aftermarket tips may not stay put (coreir brass tips thusfar have been the only ones that wouldn't stay put, but no issues with anything else, and while there aren't enough, the factory tips are very comfortable and well matched to them)The treble CAN be a little hot for people ultra sensitive to it. I personally like a brighter headphone (grado fans unite) and wouldn't even consider them very bright at all. But if you are hyper sensitive to sharp treble, these might be a bit much, though again, I'd highly encourage trying them first.But good lord. These are the most versatile IEM's I've ever tried. Particularly that glorious soundstage. Might be the best, most balanced soundstage I've ever heard in an IEM. They have just enough balance between fun and grownup that they're a no-brainer. Get some EM6L's. Nothing under $250 is as complete of a package as these sound.  "

Der Bass ist leider nicht ganz auf dem gleichen Niveau, aber ich meckere auf sehr hohem Niveau.Ich denke für den Preis sind die Dinger der Hammer und wirklich ausgezeichnet. Wesentlich besser als jedes Gamingheadset oder Bluetooth Kopfhörer die ich jemals ausprobieren konnte.    "

For gaming it feels like I have wallhack honestly and these beauties even sound great for music! Just got them yesterday so cant talk about how durable they are, but they feel solid.The only drawback is that you must buy an extender, the cable is far too short which is odd considering its a gaming orientated product. It really should come with an extender cable as standard if they do not want to make the cable bigger!But yes, amazing product.  "

I find them much better for pinpointing footsteps while gaming. The ear tips aren’t bad for stock ear tips but I think long term I will upgrade. Also I find the cable loop a bit harsh on the back of my ears as I wear glasses but I will be buying some silicone ear loops to help with that too. But as far as the quality of the IEM themselves it is very good, and has a solid build quality. Would definitely recommend as a budget or starting iem  "

Amazing music quality (harman tuning) and great for fps gaming. I bought this as my first IEM as a recommendation from Fresh Reviews on youtube and have no regrets.  Very enjoyable for music, which I also bought it for.  I do recommend making sure you get a good seal, so I had to use the Large stock tips or Dunu S&S tips, both work well.  "

"16","Shure SE215 Pro Professional Sound Isolating Earphones (Clear)  ","Chandler DeLoach","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 21 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Most comfortable IEM I've tried so far, with a great sound out of the box.Not for people who want ""neutral"" or are sensitive to treble - this is a relatively bright in-ear, with a decent bass shelf. No real soundstage to speak of, but it's an IEM, so that's par for the course. If you want to use EQ for even more bass, slightly less mids, even more treble etc. - these things will handle it perfectly.Build quality seems to be about as good as you'd hope it would be, but don't go running with them or use them at the gym - buy some cheap wireless buds instead, you don't really need to use anything high fidelity like this while you're exercising anyway.

After I left the review, I reached out to the seller for any potential remedies. They said to try cleaning it with a q-tip dipped in isopropyl alcohol, but the right earbud still sounded tinny. Because the product is under warranty, they sent out a right earbud without any hassle. After replacing the right earbud, both channels now work flawlessly and they sound amazing. I have them connected to a Fosi Audio K5 Pro, and I've only tested them in games so far, so I'm not sure about their performance while listening to music. Compared to the Truthear Hexas, I can more easily pinpoint enemy locations and hear them through walls with the SIMGOT E6ML.Intial Review:          ]  "

The IEMs are very good, very good, clean bass. It slaps. Good mids and treble. On more busy songs it can feel that the instrument separation is not very good. Good technicalities. The ear tips are meh, not good not bad, for me, they slip out of my ear canal so I had to replace them. The cable is decent, however I would have liked to see a cable with interchangeable connection. The case is nice, not pocketable but overall nice hard shell case.  I rate it a 5/5 for it's price point.  "

This is the one I prefer listening to by far and it's not even close. This IEM is already getting way more use than any of the others did over past two years. Simgot hit it out of the park with this one. It is even better imo than their more-expensive EA1000, which I also tried and reviewed. The EM6L is so good, I even bought a second pair as a backup. The only other IEM I have in my collection besides the EM6L is the IE600, which is good for more analytical listening. Otherwise, the EM6L is my go-to daily driver for fun and engagement. This can be your one and only IEM and you would be happy. It's a steal at just over $100.  "

"31","Shure SE215 Pro Professional Sound Isolating Earphones (Clear)  ","Stephen Ingraham","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 22 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Once I got the right-sized eartips on and properly level-matched these with other gear I used on my system, I immediately fell in love with how these sounded. Rich, warm, full-bodied, with well-extended but SMOOTH treble. They tick all my sound preference boxes.Though Simgot says they tuned it to match Harman 2019, I really feel they improved upon it here, notably for me the extra mid-bass and lower-mids. Harman 2019 lacks there, making the signature sound thin and hollow to me.Overall, VERY little I can fault in these IEMs.If I had to split hairs, it's that the bass, while good in quantity, feels a little fast to me, like it doesn't decay completely naturally. I suspect it has something to do with the smaller (8mm) DD they used compared to the 10mm DDs you see more often. But that's a nitpick at worst.Overall, these are an absolute steal. Dare I say these perform at least 2x their asking price, if not even more.Well done to Simgot. 2023's really been their year, and in my mind, EM6L proves it!  "

It’s been holding up well since I glued the nozzle back on and I use it every day! That’s very high praise, I have like 30 iems of various price segments, Unique Melody Mext being my most expensive at $1200. Simgot totally nailed it with this set and it’s my favorite up till the kiwi ears quintet/dunu falcon ultra. I use it more than all of my iems now. Also I now paired it with spinfit w1 tips and the cable from my aful performer 8 (can be purchased separately on hifigo).Original:My right nozzle shell twisted off while installing my first eartip (I’m no newbie, so it’s not like I was rough). I fixed it with some superglue, so not a big deal. Otherwise this iem sounds fantastic. If the ea500 or ew200 was too hot for you than this is the iem for you. It’s like an upgraded smoother/warmer ew200 with great imaging and wide stage. Not a fan of qdc cables, but no worry a .78mm 2 pin cable will fit just fine (flush works better so it’s not so long). Qdc made the fit weird and hurts my right ear, upgrading the cable solves this. I recommend pairing with spinfit w1 or dunu s&s eartips for the best comfort and sound with a wider stage.  "

These are resin with metal plates and they really look nice. The included cable is also very nice but I did replace it with a balanced one. The silicone tips are also nice and you also get a handy carry case.The sound on these is cleaner than the ea500 and it also has a more relaxed treble which is nice for long listening. The ea500 does have a fuller sound because of its single DD but you can’t really beat the details from balanced armatures. The mids and treble on these is just clean and detailed. The bass is not bad but it’s a bit elevated which makes it a bit muddy.I use a qudelix 5K so I added a little EQ to the sound to make it better for me. I reduced the bass evenly and removed a 4k peak that I don’t particularly like and the sound is just super clean, the bass is now detailed and the treble is relaxed but sparkly. I basically got an ie200 EQ profile for these and imputed the info in qudelix, they sound so good tuned this way. The EQ is not totally different from the original just slightly different so they do still sound good by default.Overall these are very good, Simgot puts a lot of effort in their recent IEMs. I like the driver configuration and that these have nozzles for each driver to avoid distortion, the drivers are also said to be of higher quality. Simgot is honestly doing a very nice job with their gear.  "

The imaging is fantastic, separation and depth are very good for the price bracket and tonality, though a bit overly bright at times, is mostly solid but that little bit of spiciness up top seems to help the imaging precision and placement so it might not be too bad to listen a tad lower volume (or on some warmish source gear if you can) than you're used to if it bothers you, but should still maintain most of the emphasis you need even at lower volumes. The fit is pretty decent overall and the isolation is pretty good too. Stock cable is pretty meh, but nothing terrible. These aren't the most natural sounding for music, but they are marketed as a gaming earbud and they do that very well. If you're looking in the $100 range for gaming audio, they're just an easy rec. Overall very solid for their purpose.  "

I have severe tinnitus and mild hearing loss, so the quality of a pair of headphones is pretty much lost on me.

The sound is as good as it gets. Detailed, rich, very clean, very clear, superb resolution and detail retrieval, great instrument separation. Nice, well-rounded balanced sound but at the same time you get quite a bit of punchy signature that lets you enjoy the music immensely while you listen. I could go on and on. Simgot is an exciting brand and they are only getting better. This set accentuates the high quality of their entire line of products. You can see the amazing packaging in my video and it goes well with the quality of the sound that comes out once you pop these into your ears. Love these! Very easy 5 star rating!  "

Linsoul SIMGOT EM6L 1DD + 4BA Hybrid Driver in-Ear Monitor, Gaming Earbud, HiFi IEMI think I got a returned set of these earbuds from Amazon. The inner box was crushed where you pull to open it. The cords were jumbled. And the extra earpieces were jammed into the outer box....Whatever, this set of earphones is phenomenal. I tried a sound test with Saint Saens's Organ Symphony and these things trashed my Jabra 85t Elites.The difference was between mud and spring water: these earbuds sounded so clear and precise I went back to see if I had messed up the Jabra's equalization somehow. Nope. And to think I loved my Jabras until about an hour ago. I liked them so much that when I lost my first pair of 85ts few months ago I bought a second pair.Not only is the sound so much better, but these have twice the volume as well--though with the better definition it doesn't sound painfully loud at higher volumes. The sound, though louder, is clearer--not a wall of sound but defined sound.I am blown away by the quality of the sound. Are there are any Bluetooth earbuds that could win a comparison test with these things?  "
