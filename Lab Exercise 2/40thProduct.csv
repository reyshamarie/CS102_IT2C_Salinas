This is my second pair. Not because the first ones died, just because I wanted a second pair kicking around.They are budget, but they punch well above their price bracket. Cable is better than older KZ models, but I would still suggest getting a cheap 4 or 8 core cable. Won't improve the sound, but they will make living with these easier.  "

"5","True Wireless Sleep Earbuds, Damipow Noise Blocking Technology Bluetooth Headphones in-Ear, Smallest and Lightest, Ultra Comfortable Designed Specifically to Help You Asleep Faster and Sleep Better  ","NS","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 4 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I bought this to use with live performance and recording monitoring but I really enjoyed the quality so I bought a bluetooth receiver.Sound quality: this will blow your mind away if you’re used to using stock phone earphones or AirPods. Do not use this for mixing recording though because they’re not neutral but you can hear each frequency really clearly without muddying each other.Looks: it looks awesome and I like the design but it can be subjective. Good thing I bought 3 of these in gold and black.Price: I bought 3 during sale but the price isn’t bad considering the quality.Noise cancellation: these don’t have ANC (obviously) but the passive noise cancellation works well and mutes the noises during train rides and public places.Comfort: they’re comfortable but I have never used them more than an hour at a timeIf you’re looking for something you can use for quality listening or monitoring, these are really good. And for the price, you simply can’t get a known-brand equivalent without spending at least $300.Highly recommended!  "

I tried memory foam ear tips and it improves the seal which in turn improves bass response dramatically. The better the seal the better the sound quality.  "

"9","True Wireless Sleep Earbuds, Damipow Noise Blocking Technology Bluetooth Headphones in-Ear, Smallest and Lightest, Ultra Comfortable Designed Specifically to Help You Asleep Faster and Sleep Better  ","TEE Mann","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 August 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I was looking for a quality set of in ear headphones and these were recommended by DankPods on YouTube. Sound quality blows away most other in-ear headphones I have tried at a similar price point. There was a good variety of ear pieces so it was easy to get a comfortable fit. They fit my ears securely - something I haven’t been able to achieve with other headphones of a similar type. The cable is good quality and doesn’t get tangled up too much. It comes separate to the headphones themselves and can easily be swapped out for a new/higher quality one. The headphones themselves have a great build quality and the clear plastic casing means you can see the drivers inside. They are not too heavy and can be worn comfortably for several hours at a time. I have been using these paired with a Dragonfly Black DAC and lossless tracks on Apple Music and so far my experience has been great. Instrument separation is good for the price and the sound isn’t overpowered by bass. They work well for all types of music - from classical to pop and rock. They have quickly become my new favourite headphones. Overall these are great for the price and I would definitely buy these again and would happily recommend them to friends and family  "
"10","True Wireless Sleep Earbuds, Damipow Noise Blocking Technology Bluetooth Headphones in-Ear, Smallest and Lightest, Ultra Comfortable Designed Specifically to Help You Asleep Faster and Sleep Better  ","KM","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 2 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I'm not an audiophile at all I'm actually hearing impaired approx 50%. I also have small ear canals and most buds hurt like heck or don't even fit properly. I figured after checking reviews go give these a chance. I do have over the ear Sony extra bass wireless but don't always want to use those. I liked the look when I opened the package was nice they are in fact, in my opinion, light weight as some said they were kind of heavy. I tried them with default tips and right away my ears hurt. I opened the pack of tips and got a huge surprise. They have extra small tips......I've never seen extra small tips in my life I mean they are so small I thought they were a joke at first.  I figured well let's go straight to these from what looks like default medium tips.They FIT... They immediately felt comfortable and there was no pain at all. They were snug in the ear and offered decent passive noise cancelling. I am very happy with that. I connected these to my iPhone 15 pro max using apple usbc to 3.5mm audio cable and sound was very nice. Like I mentioned I'm no audiophile but I know what music sounds like to me from cheap earbuds and headphones to my 350 dollar wiress Sony extra bass headphones. I love those for the over the ear. These are the best sounding earbuds I've gotten in a very long time. Now that could be because they actually fit nice or. ust because they actually are just that good. Also first time using an iem so no experience there either. A lot of the time my right ear sounded plugged up. These no problems at all so if you got small ear canals give these a shot with smallest tips.  "

"12","True Wireless Sleep Earbuds, Damipow Noise Blocking Technology Bluetooth Headphones in-Ear, Smallest and Lightest, Ultra Comfortable Designed Specifically to Help You Asleep Faster and Sleep Better  ","Moldavia","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 June 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Let me be clear, for the price - these are some of the most incredible in-ears I've had the pleasure of listening to. Now, I'm no audiophile, but I am a music lover who knows enough about sound to give a reasonable account of these. For reference, in the past I've owned Shure, Sennheiser, RHA, Bose, Cambridge Audio and more that I can't remember. I DJ (through Sennheiser HD25) so mainly listen to Trance, Techno and House. These are my first foray into 'Chi-Fi' and I think I may have just become addicted.I'm not going to use clichéd terms like ""you'll hear parts of songs you've not heard before"", because that's subjective and depends what you're used to listening to your music through. But hands down, and again, for the money, these are some of the most exciting in-ears I've owned.Compared to my daily beaters (Sennhesier Momentum IEM) these are way more forward sounding, have better sound stage, better mids and sound more dynamic and responsive. They honestly blew me away, and when doing some A/B testing with my Sennheisers I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing. These things are £20 and just smashed some £100+ earphones from one of the world's most prominent audio houses into outer space! I almost considered throwing the Sennheisers into the bin!?!They are insanely sensitive and easy to drive. From the audio out on my Windows laptop, vol 20 something is more than loud enough (once we're into the 30s/40s it gets uncomfortable) whereas I had to push my Sennheisers up to 60/70.Now the caveat, and this is down to personal taste more than anything and the music I listen to - they lack a little in the bottom end and I'd like a touch more sub-bass if I was being picky. However, I'd probably get that higher up in the KZ range spending more money on some quad driver IEMs and I may just have to try something like theZS10 or ThieAudio Legacy 2's, which I'm sure will hit a little harder on the low end. I may also try some comply tips for these...If you're not into particularly bass heavy music, and want something exciting to listen to (I'd imagine Jazz would sound great on these) then these have to be on your list. Bottom line; exceptional for the money and most people would be more than happy with these!  "

Fully expected to have to replace them almost immediately but have been pleasantly surprised. The sound is great for what I need it for. Good balance through the ranges and a surprisingly good bass to them. Used regularly for a few months now and they’re fab, would get them again if needed!  "

And OH MY GOD was he right. These things sound amazing, fit fantastic, and are super powerful. The extra bass and treble are perfect for outside use as those are usually the stuff you lose to outside noise. I have been able to hear things in my favorite pieces of music that I’ve never heard before. The comfort is great, at first it was a bit confusing because the cord goes around your ear but I got it pretty quickly. I am stunned that these hard phones are as cheap as they are, they are so worth the money and are only $5 more than earbuds which in my opinion sound no where near as good as these do. Would 100% recommend if you want to take your listening experience to the next level.  "
