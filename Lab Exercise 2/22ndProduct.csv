I wear them with Zoom calls, using the microphone of the computer or a seperate microphone. As they are clear coloured and the cables are arranged neatly at the back people can hardly see them, so visually I look better, more professional. Plus, as they are foam in-ear plugs (very comfortable) there is no feedback to my microphone, and so my voice is clearer with no echo. Oh... they sound great too. Now, even though the cable is a generous length I do use an extension 3.5 mini to mini cable, so its easy for me to get back from my computer if I want. I leave them on and just unplug when leaving my computer. The little shirt clip stops them falling off. They really though of everything. Packaging and accessories are well thought out as well. You can definitely buy this brand with confidence. I learnt about them from some live streaming pros who recommended them.  "

"9","Nokia Wireless Earbuds, Bluetooth 5.3 Earphones in Ear with Dual ENC Noise Cancelling Mic,Touch Control Earbuds Deep Bass Stereo Sound, 20H Playtime Wireless Headphones, Black E3102Plus (Black)  ","Client d'Amazon","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 16 February 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","        6-month EDIT: Still great sound quality and durability. Due to personal issues with fit, and other minor details, I'd alter my rating to *4.5*.I've grown to really like the sound from these. I'm happy to use them for casual mixing (with caveats) when I don't want to use headphones, and I'm impressed with the build and ruggedness. They make me want to listen to music for the fun of it, and that's something. The isolation is hilariously good if you get a good fit, almost as good as putting in foam earplugs, even though you don't stuff these into the ear canal.Sonically, even with a 5mm driver the sound is impressive, with good detail up top and with the low bass tending towards ""fun"" rather than accurate. Personally I like that for the price, it makes audio exciting, makes this more of an all-rounder. That bass doesn't muddy the low mids - it's just a bit of supplementation to support the rest of the sound. The high mids are good for music but a little too prominent for speech, leading sometimes to more sibilance than I'd like around 6kHz. But that's the only thing I'd want changing, sound-wise, and it doesn't actually bother me on music. If you don't like the bass here, it's pretty easy to EQ it down on most smartphones by about 2dB, without artefacts.Not at all a super wide soundstage like you get with a Campfire Audio earphones, but they would cost 20 times the price of this. I like the immediacy of this set. If I want soundstage, I'll go for listening with open-back headphones.Build is solid with plenty of accessories; good carry case, two cables (one with mic), plenty of silicone tips (inc. large and small triple flanges) and one set of foam earphones as well. That second cable with a mic is great in case one cable breaks (seems unlikely), and it doesn't affect the sound quality at all. However, the mic quality is poor, very muffled, so I'd save it for short calls when you're not in noisy environment. I keep that cable on purely for the play/pause button - or assistant if you wish. Cables are really nice and strong, but there's a fair bit of cable noise. Strangely though you get used to this, and there's an included clip which might help.Comfort-wise, they took a bit of getting used to. The cables are detachable - though they aid the noise isolation by creating the seal, so keep them attached for best isolation. The memory wire works with a metal wire encased with the cabling for about 8cm from the earphone. Because of this, the wire's profile is larger and slightly stretched, and can get in the way of larger glasses' stalks. It takes some days of getting used to but it's worth the experimentation. They also help to relieve stress on the earphone if they get yanked out accidentally, and when running, they do keep the earphones on the ear rather than falling to the ground.But the fit is still really incumbent on the main module fitting well, and with my small ears, I've found that even when walking, they come loose sooner than I want, regardless of tips used (maybe I should get some custom ones). If I put on a sprint, they'll be loose very quickly, and you lose all the bass if the fit is off. But that's just my ears, you might honestly find them perfect running partners. When I'm not moving around they stay in place well. Not headphone-well, but enough that it doesn't bother me.For sure though, they're not the best for side-sleepers listening at night. They're a fair bit larger than, say, Apple's old earphones, which for all their faults are probably my pick for that use case, with their very flat profile.A few misconceptions:1. These are noise isolating, but not noise cancelling. Don't expect the sudden eerie quiet you get from a Bose QuietComfort or Sony WH-1000 series when you turn those on. However, the isolation is so good that I have trouble understanding the person speaking next to me even indoors, especially with the Comply foam tips used. From reading tech reviews, these apparently isolate nearly as well as Shure earphones, which have the best isolation around. No reason to doubt this.2. These aren't for high-level mixing. Reference sound quality is never this inexpensive. They would work well for monitoring audio on location, because they isolate so well, and the bass boost will compensate for the bass frequencies from the environment which are impossible to isolate out. I've also used these on stage but I don't recommend that. The isolation is just too good you can't make out anything else properly. I ended up taking them off on that occasion.Overall then, for earphones with wires going over the ear, these are probably the best value around. I got the clear pair for £35. Expect a solid build and good sound quality, and be prepared to spend some time getting the right fit for your ears. If you want something better, you'll probably need to spend more. I've enjoyed having these beside my AKG K702, Bose QC25, SoundMAGIC E30, and Earpods. All very different, all useful. The M6 PRO 2nd are the best all-rounders of them all!  "

"11","Nokia Wireless Earbuds, Bluetooth 5.3 Earphones in Ear with Dual ENC Noise Cancelling Mic,Touch Control Earbuds Deep Bass Stereo Sound, 20H Playtime Wireless Headphones, Black E3102Plus (Black)  ","Traumtänzer","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 December 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I absolutely love these, and i'm very picky with what I play music through.Sound qulity is very good, but volume is lacking slightly. The volume is made up for by the addition of the pair of Comply earbuds, which are memory foam and do a great job of noise-cancellation.The wire in the cable to bend and form around your ear is perfect, and i'm a very big fan of that.The little carry case is also a great addition, but, potentially a little too big for an everyday carry case. It stores the extra cable, and other accesories, but for an everyday thing, without the need to take everything that comes with it with you, a smaller case would be a bit better.I use these for everything. And they get used for a good chunk of the day, every day. I use them while walking, running, in the gym, and I use them for under my motocycle helmet. They fit in my ear nicely, and stay where they are when taking off and putting on the helmet! They also do a great job of blocking out road noise, and giving good sound quality. (I only wear one earphone while riding my motorcyle and it it the one on the opposite side of the road. (in the UK that's my left ear, when i ride in Europe, my right ear))Overall, good quality, good durability and great value for money!  "
"12","Nokia Wireless Earbuds, Bluetooth 5.3 Earphones in Ear with Dual ENC Noise Cancelling Mic,Touch Control Earbuds Deep Bass Stereo Sound, 20H Playtime Wireless Headphones, Black E3102Plus (Black)  ","TheRecorder","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Italy on 6 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Recensione di una che di audio non ci capisce nulla se non che è bello quando le cose suonano bene. Ero un po' scettica perché volevo delle cuffiette con un sonoro discreto e che fossero abbastanza isolanti. Sono rimasta estremamente soddisfatta.Le cuffiette sono solide, robuste. Il cavo si stacca dagli auricolari, dunque è sostituibile - ma sembra comunque di ottima fattura. Il che fa intendere che sono progettate per durare. Vedremo, ma sono ottimista :)Nella confezione, oltre ad una bella custodia, ci sono tanti tappetti di diverse misure, il che è stato un bene. Ho dovuto usare le più piccole per farle incastrare bene - se le cuffiette non si poggiano bene nelle orecchie potrebbero esserci problemi a sentire i bassi.Non sono audiofila, né appassionata di un genere in particolare, ed il fatto che siano molto bilanciate mi piace. Noto sicuramente una grossa differenza rispetto alle mie solite cuffiette da 5€. Il suono è caldo e profondo ed è un piacere ascoltare musica e suoni calibrati (ho trovato queste cuffiette proprio tra le consigliate dal creatore di mynoise, un sito che uso spesso per alleviare problemi di ansia e mal concentrazione). Ho anche riscontrato un'ottima esperienza attaccandole alla switch: nei giochi con un buon sonoro è un'esperienza d'immersione auditoria.Non sono cuffiette del tutto isolanti (non vogliono esserlo) ma con musica a volume basso riesco a non sentire nemmeno la TV nella stessa stanza a volume massimo. Insomma: per me sono più che sufficienti. Le ho scelte trasparenti per una pura questione estetica e ne sono molto contenta.Unica pecca: un po' scomode sulle lunghe durate. Sia perché sono in-ear sia perché può fare fastidio alle orecchie il modo in cui il cavo deve passare sopra. Ma per un paio d'ore d'ascolto vanno benissimo, e dopo un po' ci si fa l'abitudine.Immagino che professionisti, audiofili o amanti di generi specifici possano trovare cuffiette più costose e più adatte alle loro esigenze. Io dal canto mio mi ritengo molto soddisfatta!    "

La verdad es que no soy una persona que le prestara mucha atención a los in Ear. Aún así decidí invertir en unos audífonos  de gama media baja de entrada, nada muy costoso. Mi primera opción eran los Shure e215, pero tras ver un montón de reseñas en YT me encontré con estos M6 pro, las prestaciones eran muy parecidas. y pese a que sabia que el sonido era inferior, terminé por comprarlos por las prestaciones a bajo costo.En primer lugar debo decir que, por todos los accesorios que incluyen, ya es un muy buen trato. Dos cables, uno de ellos con control, seis pares de puntas de silicon y un par de gomas de espuma de memoria comply (que quería probar desde hace tiempo) más el adaptador a 6.3 mm y un case semi rígido. La construcción es de plástico, pero debo decir que se siente bastante sólida. Los cables se perciben de buena calidad con guardacables tanto en el Jack como en la separación de los extremos que van a los audífonos.Ahora bien el sonido. Las quejas de muchas personas respecto a los bajos están justificadas, aunque parte  de este ""problema"" tiene mucho que ver con escoger la punta de silicon correcta que embone de manera correcta a tu canal auditivo. Si la punta elegida te queda bien, notarás una mejora significativa en la calidad del audio y en el aislamiento del ruido exterior. Si aún así sientes que no tienes una buena respuesta en bajos no hay nada que no se pueda arreglar con un ajuste al equalizador, aunque los que gustan de bajos exagerados se sentirán timados. Para los que gusten de escuchar música a frecuencias planas, están bien.Para los fans de las specsDriver de 10 mmrespuesta de frecuencia 20Hz a 20KHzImpedancia 16 Omssensibilidad 100±3 dB (1mW at 1KHZ)largo del cable 1.3 mcertificación IPX5 de resistencia al agua (no te emociones, es solo resistencia al sudor)Pros.- Buen audio- Cables removibles- Muchos accesorios- El control sirve con Android y iOS- Cómodos y resistentes al sudor- El aislamiento es mejor que el de unos in ear comunes- Bastante económicos (50 USD)Contras- Construcción (son de plástico)- Necesitas tomarte tu tiempo para colocarlos correctamente- La mayoría de los usuarios requerirán ajustar los bajos a través del equalizadorPese a los puntos en contra, no encuentro motivo para bajarles una sola estrella. Estos M6 pro son una excelente opción para entrar al mundo de los in ear de calidad de gama de entrada a un muy bajo costo. Seguro me servirán hasta que pueda ir por una gama más alta.    "

The audio quality is quite good for the price range and with the several tip options it is easy to find a comfortable one. Would be nice to have a play/pause button on the cord, at least the one with the microphone, but that's just for convenience.What really impressed me about MEE was their customer service. At about 4 months in there was a sound imbalance on the left monitor. Their website has clear instructions for troubleshooting which helped me find the origin of the issue. Then upon contacting the service, they quickly offered to repair the faulty monitor. Once I explained to them that the shipping to send the monitor from DK to USA would be too high for me, they just took a simple step to verify my purchase and offered to send a replacement instead, at their cost, which has now arrived and works perfectly (:All in all, extremely helpful and polite!

When reading the reviews for these IEMs I was surprised that most people reviewing them were using them primarily as ear buds for their smart phones so I was hesitant to buy them use for live music performance. After doing more research on MEE, I thought that I would give them a try. I was looking into getting another set of custom molded IEMs but didn't feel like spending hundreds or thousands of dollars. The M6 Pros are fantastic! They give a nice representation of highs, mids and lows. They don't have a big bass boost or anything (which I didn't want) as I need to hear the clarity of the various frequencies coming from the other instruments and vocals on stage. The M6 Pros come with a ton of various different tips to customize your fit and sound preferences as well as 2 detachable cables, accessories and a great carrying case. They are very durable and if you ever need to replace a cable, you can do that without having to replace the actual ear monitors. When I first began using the M6 Pros the high end was a little harsh to my ears but as the drivers got burned in over about 4 hours of use, the highs tamed down and there is a nice EQ of highs, mids and lows. If you are looking for a quality set of IEMs for live performance and don't want to spend a ton of cash, definitely give the M6 Pros a try. I am super happy with them and would buy them again! Thanks MEE for delivering professional quality IEMs at such a great price point!  "

These are fantastic IEMs. The quality is rich, the bass is pronounced and well rounded, not boomy or loud.Mids are pronounced and rich. They are a little peaky towards the higher mids and required pulling back, could have been just my pair but after the one small tweak they have been perfectTop end -I did have to round mine off for my personal preference but the top end and brilliance is incredible. They are so clear and crisp so if your ear is lacking in top end, these can certainly make up for it.Comfort-These are so Comfortable with little to no ear fatigue. I wear them 6-7 hours a day at my desk for both work and gaming and then for another 1.5 hours at the gym.Inside the gym they do not move from ear and offer a solid grip and feel. The isolation is fantastic with no external bleed to upset anyone near by but also don't let any external noise in.Overall -These earphones offer quality and value for money. They are a great starting point if you want to get into IEMs but also a brilliant point of quality for price. No one should hesitate buying these.  "

My review is accurate, however it's nearly 2 years later now and they're still going!! And that's with some heavy use. I regularly use them under my motorcycle helmet as well as when I want to listen in bed (falling asleep many times). They've outlasted 'premium' in headphones costing 3x more. The better seal in your ears, the better they sound.So I've changed my 4 star to a 5!*Original review*They are just about worth what you pay for them.In a quiet area these are fine with a balanced sound.Adjust the bass or treble in a variety of music genres and they cope well.However, they are no where near what I'd class as monitor headphones. Monitors need to exactly match the input throughout the Hz range and these cannot do that. But for the money it was highly unlikely that'd be the case (unfortunately).They are not noise cancelling, no matter which set of earbuds you put in.I purchased these to fit under my motorcycle helmet which they do very well, however I also wanted some noise isolation to reduce the wind noise which they do not do at all.Unlike the other reviewer I do not have any issue with the comfort. In fact I've fallen asleep with these headphones in, a lot, and not awoke with painful ears on any occasion. I can even lie my head fully on one side and listen without discomfort so it got an extra star just for that.They come with an extra cable so I think that'll add to the overall durability.All in all not bad, but didn't do the job I bought them for.

I picked up a set of these on a recommendation from another professional bassist. Not because they are ""the best"" but because they are affordable, the sound is ""okay"", and they are very durable.After wearing these for a week tracking bass lines and performing in a small show, I'm very pleased with their performance. After following the instructions on their site on how to fit and set the IEMs, I didn't experience the lack of clarity in the bass or loss of the lower end as other have said. I normally use flat response headphones and monitors, so my expectations may be different than others.With that being said, I did order a 2 driver version because I want a dedicated driver for the lower frequencies. I don't think these are good enough if you do mixing and mastering in a studio with because you do lose some frequencies, but they are good enough for tracking and small shows.All-in-all, if you don't feel comfortable shelling out $400+ on a upper end IEM, these are a great alternative. The sound is good, the durability is great, the noise cancelling is okay, and I don't really think you can beat the price.  "

(I've only worn these for about 60hrs over the course of a week.)tl;dr version:... it's in the tagline. I have nothing negative to say about these IEMs. This is not a ""5-stars at this $50 price-point"" score; I'd still give it 5-stars if it cost twice as much. Adjustable comfort ""for days"" (or at least 12 hours in one go), blocks out the world, reproduces the sound completely and faithfully, and comes with a good number of accessories/options.Comfort:Probably the only pair of in-ear monitors I've comfortably worn for long hours without issues. The generous accessories pack includes a multitude of silicone tips (and also a ""first one's free"" pair of Comply branded foam inserts) so getting the right fitment in-ear is not an issue. When you couple that with the thin but soft memory wire to set it in place around your specific ear shape, there's no way anything else can come close to being this secure and comfortable.Motorcycle note: These monitors do not protrude from your ears so work well under a helmet. The memory wire also helps to keep intermittent tugs from pulling them out while at speed. If you route them behind your back the large-ish bit of plastic that encompasses the wire intersection Y-join can dig into your back under a back protector and will get uncomfortable on rides beyond an hour.Sound:Very responsive and detailed. Faithful reproduction of all frequencies. If I am to nitpick I would say that JB's impression is spot-on accurate; there is a bit of ""boom"" to the bass. Not a whole lot; you can dial it out if that is your preference. Do not expect these to crush your skull with bass. That is not what they are intended to do. Rather, if you want to hear the music as it was intended to be heard you can't go wrong with this product.Motorcycle note: The memory foam Comply tips do a great job of blocking out noise so you don't have to crank your music to hear over the wind, thus saving your hearing. Think of them as earplugs that also happen to produce beautiful music.Accessories (see photo):There is nothing missing from the set. The included hard-case is nicely sized for protection and portability. The usual assortment of silicone tips are included; small, medium, large in both single flange tips and isolating (2 and 3 flange/baffle design). A bag of medium sized Comply tips are also included (my preferred tips). Musicians will appreciate the included 1/8"" minijack to 1/4"" stereo jack converter but I haven't had a reason to use that yet. Also included is a second cable (yes, this thing is modular) that contains an inline mic for calls (or piece-of-mind back-up cable if you somehow damage the other). By default, the unit ships with the non-mic enabled cable attached but changing them out isn't hard if you go that route. Lastly, there is a functional clip that makes short work of slack management for wire routing purposes.Misc final note:MEE didn't splash a garish logo on these so there's always that bonus if you don't like being a walking billboard.

"38","Nokia Wireless Earbuds, Bluetooth 5.3 Earphones in Ear with Dual ENC Noise Cancelling Mic,Touch Control Earbuds Deep Bass Stereo Sound, 20H Playtime Wireless Headphones, Black E3102Plus (Black)  ","Daniel Hur","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 19 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        OVERALL: These earbuds are incredible. I use them primarily on stage with Aviom personal mixers and the balance is far better than both the M6 Sport earbuds and any budget in-ear monitor I've used. I easily forget I'm wearing earbuds and imagine the music is in the room with me.CONS: The mid-range can get muddled, but I've only experienced this when there is an overwhelming amount of mids already in the mix (worse since I am a pianist). For casual listening, using an acoustic EQ helped when listening to music with lots of guitars, for example, all in the same range. The EQ improved overall clarity, which was already phenomenal.The only other con is the size of the headphone jack. If you are purchasing these for use with a phone, you might consider an adapter to downsize the 3.5mm jack that is on the M6 PRO cable. The adapter is 6-7mm wide.  It will not fit with my phone case, so I simply use a lighting-3.5mm adapter if needed. This is a nit-picky inconvenience, but one that is worth noting if you don't already have an adapter.PROS: I am in love with the sound quality of these in-ear monitors for the price. It is neither bass nor treble-heavy. There is a great balance between them, with softer mids. Kick drums come through with some punch and depth, and the bass feels warm and deep. The treble on these IEMs is crystal clear, something that is super useful for picking out piano parts from a track.Cable quality feels good, the memory wire around the ear is sturdy, and the earbud housing is barely noticeable in the ear. My sister, who does not like over-ear earbuds, even commented that the cases felt like pillows in her ear.I don't know if the tip/housing angle is different, but these earbuds sealed in my ears much more quickly than the M6 Sports. If you have odd ear canals like me, I'd give these a try, and even consider the custom molds. I did not know MEE Audio offered the custom molds, and the M6 PRO's come with a 10% discount for a set.FINAL THOUGHTS: I was on the fence with these for a long time, and even have a pair of Shure IEMs. I still keep coming back to the sound of the M6 PROs. If you're on the fence, pull the trigger. You won't regret it. Also, consider the Bluetooth adapter if you're in it for casual listening. I left a review on that page as well. Happy Listening!  "

I do both audio production and performance (as a musician/producer), and voice production (as a university lecturer). I've used these with Universal Audio apollo hardware (x4) and with Presonus 32R aux outs, as well as via DAC on multiple iOS and other computer hardware. I've also used over ear cans  including the AKG240 and the classic Sony MDR-7506. For buds I'm comparing with 5 driver KZ-ZS10 Pro's, which are also good products, but are in my experience more fragile, and MUCH more prone to tangling. Frequency range of the M6 Pro is excellent and relatively flat for buds, which generally are extremely variable depending on how you place them in your external ear. But the best part is the warranty support. I don't know what happened, but the left bud suddenly got rather warm, then cut out completely. A brief exchange via MEE's warranty department resulted in 2-day shipping of a replacement bud, which is working great. That's hard to find these days. A+ for MEE and these M6 Pro monitors.  "

I ride motorcycles and the speakers that are placed inside of the helmet are pretty much designed to make one deaf.  Helmets are loud from wind noise and buffeting.  The speakers just make it worse because they just add to the noise.  I started out with a very nice IEM, but they were nearly impossible to get my helmet on over.  I saw a review for these and decided to give them a try.  They do not stick out of my ears very far and I can easily put my helmet on over them and the seal in my ears was good.  Now I can ride with my communicator volume set quite low and I will be able to hear for a very long time.  The company offers custom silicone ear tips for these.  They are a little pricey and I had to get impressions made of my ears, but they give a really precise fit that takes them to another level.  Unfortunately, my motorcycling season pretty quickly ends once the time changes because it is dark when I get home.  They will be really nice next year.  "

I own two pairs of studio monitoring over-ear headphones which I use for mixing and mastering music, as well as for listening to music without an enhanced sound.I get hot easily wearing over ear headphones, so I wanted in ear monitors that would still provide a neutral yet detailed listening experience, and these are just what I wanted!They sound very close to my over ear monitors. A nice flat sound signature that still provides a very high quality listening experience. Bass is not enhanced, mids are present; the treble is not as crisp as my over ear headphones, but it's definitely there, just seems to be a little softer, but not muffled or dull in the slightest and actually really pleasant to listen to. I can definitely use these for mixing and won't need to worry about any part of the sound being exaggerated.I am very happy with these. It also has a nice amount of bonus equipment. Six extra pairs of ear tips, shirt clips, which I never thought I would see again, a 1/4"" jack adapter!!! Perfect as I can use it with my audio interface where other earbuds won't work even with an adapter. It also has an extra cable with a microphone! The mic is cool, it picks up a fair bit of noise but nothing too awful, perfectly adequate for recording quick vocals; and it doesn't pick up a lot of sibilance, which is another plus.Only thing I don't like are the the memory wires that go behind your ears. They're pretty finicky to try and get right and to get the buds to sit properly in your ears. Once you get it just right, it's fine though, and more than worth dealing with for that wonderful sound!I highly recommend these for people who want a neutral audio profile for either mixing music or just casual listening without an enhanced sound.

I listened to music at a low volume and I couldn't hear my mom talking at a normal volume 2 meters away.Using the non-sound isolating plugs however makes it quite easy to hear what is happening around you, which is great if you are using these in places where you need to be vary of the sounds around you.The packaging itself is really solid, and it comes with a lot of items inside, which is a big plus!
