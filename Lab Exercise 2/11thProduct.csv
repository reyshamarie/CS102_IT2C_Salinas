Absolutely amazing for the price and for non-wired earphones. Has a decent soundstage and can suprisingly distinguish sounds well enough on lossless music. I've even found myself thinking I was hearing people around me when I left YouTube playing. The noise cancelling and the microphone quality are good enough. Only real downside is the battery life. I believe the earphones last 4 and the case adds 12 hours. I haven't run out of battery yet though.  "

"6","Bose Ultra Open Earbuds with OpenAudio Technology, Open Ear Wireless Earbuds, Up to 48 Hours of Battery Life, Black  ","N Mor","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Poland on 8 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I've been sporting the Airpods Pro for the last couple of years, but lost it during a road trip. I absolutely loved the sound Airpods Pro produced with the 'Rock' apple music EQ and the 'brightness' on minimum in the accessibility setting; high treble and clear mids with a weak bass (compromise for clarity). It is a must for me to hear the 'fine' details in music, and so as a broke student in college who absolutely needed bluetooth earbuds, I came across these via recommendations on other websites.I gave these a shot because the internet seemed to praise the Moondrop Space Travel's drivers. The case and pods themselves are light (to be expected as they are made of plastic.) That's not to say that they feel and are built cheap- The case build reminds me of an iPhone power adapter.As for the ANC and Passthrough; majority of the reviews I read stated that they were pretty useless. However, I was taken aback when ANC engaged by itself. They are not AT ALL useless. While it seems to struggle with higher-pitched noises, ANC cancels low-medium drone noises such as fans, air conditioning, etc. very well. I would even say they're just as good as Airpod Pros (although I have had mine for a couple years so effectiveness has probably dwindled, take that with a grain of salt.) With the passthrough, you can definitely distinguish between having it off and having it on. The sound that passes through is about as good as having Airpods 1 on- There's the feeling of having something in your ear but due to the imperfect seal the sound passes through fairly easily. Don't let that discourage you though, it's still a great feature.Now to the REAL meat and bones of the show- the sound quality. It's GREAT. One of the best earbuds I've owned. Insane. Quality. Amazing. Need I say more? They rival the sound quality of Gen. 1 Airpod Pros. Treble and mids are clear, the bass is punchy, there's a wide and great soundstage, you can hear each instrument independently yet they all merge in blissful harmony. It's insanely good for it's price tag (And not to brag but, I got them for $10 because of rewards ;-) )  I was actually fairly surprised at how great the bass was as well. With the EQ settings in my airpods pros, the bass was fairly weak but treble and mids are more important to me so I had to compromise. With my personal EQ settings and these headphones I'm getting clear treble with punchy bass.The app feels incomplete and doesn't seem to have manual EQ adjustment as others suggest, that's something that may have to be adjusted via your music app or device. However, they give you multiple ways to adjust your earbud's touch function which is really nice. I only have them on for 2-3 hours at a time, so battery life hasn't been a problem yet.Time will tell how durable these are, but I'm incredibly satisfied. I rarely give out such detailed reviews, but these truly deserve it. Go grab a pair!  "

"11","Bose Ultra Open Earbuds with OpenAudio Technology, Open Ear Wireless Earbuds, Up to 48 Hours of Battery Life, Black  ","Ken","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 8 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Very affordable. Light and comfortable. Clear mids and highs that distort sometimes at louder volumes. Lacks bass. Low to average battery life relative to the entire field but not bad for the price bracket. Fiddly to replace buds into charging case, but cool 90s anime design. Audio feedback is an anime girl voice which might be annoying for some. Only single status LED. Touch area was not 100% consistent detecting touches but got it right most of the time. Noise cancelling not the best but better than expected at this price. Picks up and passes through wind noise a lot, but fine for indoor/stationary use. A couple of fit and finish gripes here and there, and doesn't look like it would take to sweat or water splash too well, but can't complain for the price.Phone app was not on google play and required sideloading so don't bother. Default settings are fine. YouTube video sync lags a bit when connected to standalone APTx TaoTronics transmitter (TT-BA08), but works fine directly to android phone.Had a weird connection issue where one channel would cut out for a moment, then come back. Could possibly be interference from BT signal traffic of other nearby devices, not really sure.These would make an amazing gift.  "

Ridiculously strong bass, good mids. Only weak on treble, eq should help.)Transparency: 8/10 (not too much hiss, everything audible)NC: 6/10 (blocks noise ok, wind still audible. Insane to even have at this price.)Battery: 4/10 ( I can see it go down as I'm looking at the percentage. To be expected from this level but was hoping for better)Just got mine today. QC is definitely an issue with moondrop. Had problens with the Chu and the right buds on these also turn off by themselves. The experience is worse compared to my Sonys but audio quality is great. All the compromises are worth it for this level of audio fidelity. The mic indoors is also great. How these passed QC with a massive dent in the case is a riddle to me.  "

"15","Bose Ultra Open Earbuds with OpenAudio Technology, Open Ear Wireless Earbuds, Up to 48 Hours of Battery Life, Black  ","Amazon Customer","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 29 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Been using them since they came out.I like them a lot. Sound is good, app works well (you need to download the .apk from moondrops homepage at the time of writing this).Battery life is so-so, but you have plenty of charge in the case.But the case....*Charge port is on the bottom - not too smart*No lid - dirt will enter and accumulate over time. The ""wells"" the headphones sit in is deep and narrow, so the contact points are very hard to clean. Bad connections is eminent after a couple of months use.* No lid - although the magnets hold the headphones in place fairly well, if you put it in a pocket or bag, you will constantly get connections from the moondrops while moving. This can be very annoying if you're using other headphones, but especially so if talking on the phone at the time this happens. Also you might need to search for a lost headphone in your bag once in a while.The leather case you can buy for them seems to be of really bad quality, so I wouldn't suggest getting that, BUT there are some really nice 3d-files out there to print, that seem to solve or minimize the problems with the case.Either way, if you enjoy good sounding items I would still recommend them. If you need 3+ hours of battery life and want some really punchy bass, you might want to look at some Sonys or something instead, but at this price range, I seriously doubt you'll find anything better. Probably not at double the price either.TL;DR: Sound good. Case and battery bad. Still worth. Also I think they look cool.  "

La calidad de sonido es muy buena, además se insertan muy bien en el oído. Trae tres tamaños de almohadillas para cambiar a tu gusto según tu tamaño de canal auditivo.En general me parece muy buena compra, tienen un diseño diferente y moderno, lo mejor de ellos es el sonido, simplemente brillante.Ambos auriculares tienen botones táctiles para controlar la reproducción y la cancelación de ruido, que por cierto funciona bien.Como inconveniente solo el encuentro, que podría tener una tapa para que no entre el polvo, pero como podéis ver en la imagen se puede imprimir una en 3D y queda genial.Además la aplicación está aún muy verde, no sé si se seguirá mejorando, pero no es tan intuitiva y algunas cosas están en chino o en inglés. Este es el mayor inconveniente que le veo, la aplicación no está para nada tan desarrollada como otras marcas como además la tienes que descargar desde su propia web porque no está la Google Play.Sin embargo por su precio como solo puedo recomendar los tanto por la calidad de sonido como por el diseño. Tened en cuenta que en este rango de precio, encontrar unos auriculares que se escuchen bien es muy difícil, aún más difícil encontrar que tengan cancelación de ruido.    "

The tuning is very good, as expected from Moondrop (I own a pair of Arias myself). I find myself enjoying both kpop and rap out of theseThe sound is supposedly basically the same as the Nekocake. Soundstage and imaging are decent, you can make out where the instruments are coming from. Vocals are natural sounding. Bass is powerful, I would think that the average consumer would love it, but it might be too much for some audiophiles I suppose. Treble is energetic but not fatiguing (ahem KZ)The app (I tested it on the Apple App Store) allows you to change the tuning with three presets, but I would just leave it as the reference setting. You can also change the tap functions, but default is fine enough. Just wish I could double tap *either* earbuds to skip and triple tap to go back, like AirPods ProWhich brings me to my comparison to the AirPods Pro Gen 1, which I own. I got these Space Travels since my AirPods had been giving me issues lately, like connectivity and static. Anyway, these sound better than the AirPods right out of the box. The noise cancelling on the Space Travel works for sure, you can feel the ""sucking effect"" in your ear, just like any ANC headphones. Obviously it's not as strong as my Bose 700 or AirPods Pro, but it's effective enough with some music playing. The transparency mode works... but it doesn't feel that much different from when it's off. Nothing will beat the AirPods Pro with Transparency Mode, but these do come a little close to Bose 700 transparency.There is no lid, yes, but the magnets are very strong and you cannot shake out the buds. Dust and lint might get in the case if the buds are out? That's really the flaw here.I just really do wish these had multipoint pairing, where I could use these with both my laptop and phone. Speaking of, when you first connect these to a Windows laptop, they're recognized as like a calling device so the audio quality is terrible and very loud. I think that may just be a Windows thing; they're never good with bluetooth anyway... Pairing is very flawless with these anyway, no complaints  "

Möchte man also einen V-Sound, so muss man sich einen externen Equalizer herunterladen, um ein wenig Bass genießen zu können.Akku:Ich persönlich nutze die Kopfhörer in der Bahn auf dem Weg zur und von der Uni (jeweils ca 2h), weshalb ich über die Akkuleistung der Kopfhörer nicht viel sagen kann. Das Case muss ich je nach Nutzung dann alle 1-2 Wochen laden.Qualität:Es ist zwar alles aus Kunststoff, jedoch fühlt dieser sich keineswegs billig an. Alles passt genau wie es soll. Einzig das Reinstecken sowie Herausnehmen der Kopfhörer aus dem Case ist... fragwürdig? Es ist jedenfalls nicht intuitiv und führte einmal dazu, dass meine Kopfhörer auf den Boden gefallen sind.ANC:In der Bahn merkt man auf jeden Fall einen Unterschied: das leise Summen und Brummen verschwindet quasi komplett. Die Gespräche anderer werden nicht unterdrückt, Windgeräusche sogar verstärkt.Verbindung:Obwohl die Kopfhörer Bluetooth 5.3 besitzen, supporten diese leider nur bis zu SBC/AAC (320kBit/s), was mich enttäuscht. Die Verbindung hatte bisher nur zwei mal Probleme und der ""Gaming""-Modus mit einer Latenz von 55ms ist auf jeden Fall brauchbar.Fazit:Meckern auf sehr hohem Niveau! Sound top, super bequem und bringt Spaß - aber an jeder Stelle wurden 1-2 kleine Abstriche gemacht, denen man sich bewusst sein soll.Haben trotzdem meine Sony 1000XM3 abgelöst.    "

Good fit and seal and only fall out with excessive headbanging.The sound is very good! Maybe even better than my old Jaybird Vistas. Decent bass and voices are nice and clear. The ANC is very good and even at my noise workplace the ANC works excellent. They passive isolation however isn't that good on their own.Sound pass trough modes add a lot of hissing in a high noise environment, so that is one downside.One weak spot for the ANC is high frequenzies emitted by things like ultrasonic cleaners. I can't get within 2 meters of my tiny cleaner with any of the ANC/pass features, it starts crackling like crazy static.The battery is pretty damn good. I get about 3 1/2 to 4h with ANC+playback, ANC always on and playback sometimes paused for talk.BT connectivity has been flawless so far, but calls have been a hit and miss. Some people say it's good, some can't understand me clearly.One big issue is the controlls and audio featback. You have audio prompts when switching between modes or low battery. Hower, even in a quiet room you don't hear anything. Way to quiet, as if a baby is whispering you thing across a room... and no way to make it louder.The controlls are touch on the stem. I manage to play/pause/skip about every other tap.So far my rating for the buds themself:- Sound 8/10- Battery 8/10- ANC 6.5/10- Passtrough 4/10- BT 10/10- Calls 6/10- Fit 7/10- Prompts/controlls 3/10Now the big pill of poop that is the charging case. It looks good, is crap. It's not covering your buds, so they get lint all over them. It's a paint to get the buds in and out since you have to slide in the stem all the way down and not have it tillt. Taking them out is only possible by shaking or squezing the stem to the top, which can active some functions like change track or dissable ANC untril you manage them out somehow...Very ugly engineering here.But for the price... you don't get any better buds imo.

The ANC does block a whole lot of noise and the noise it tries to block makes it difficult to tell which direction the noise is coming from.

The noise cancelling and transparency mode work fairly well which is an absolute miracle at this price range. The battery life is fantastic between the earbuds and the case and they come with a good range of ear tip sizes. Unfortunately these have on and off latency issues so watching any sort of video the audio and visuals will be off by about half a second which is pretty considerable, even in low latency game mode. This latency issue can usually be resolved either by toggling between the two latency modes or by placing them in the case and reconnecting. It usually comes back within ten or fifteen minutes so that makes watching movies with them pretty unpleasant. Overall these are a really great value and if you plan on just using them for music or tuning out an airplane they are a definite buy. If however you intent to use these for movies and television i would maybe look elswhere.  "

Downloaded the app and it won't connect to it, so there are multiple features unavailable to apple users.Also, the ear tips have my the inside of my ears very sore after about 15 minutes use.Good value, pretty decent sound for the price but the issue with the app is a deal breaker for me and I think I'll be returning them.

I'm having one side not charge because of dirt build up, its very annoying. Good sound like all the other reviewers are saying but do not buy, buy something else  "

They always feel like they're about to slip right out even if they don't. I'm always aware of them dangling out of my ear. The touch controls are annoying as I'm constantly having to adjust them (refer to previous statement) which causes frequent pauses and changing modes accidentally. Really unusable when moving around a lot while at work or eating as the seal keeps breaking as my jaw moves. Case is also finicky as I have to play around with it to get it in the case but the magnets do a good job of holding them in.I would suggest the 1more stylish (using wavelet , autoeq to 1more dual driver, bass boosted) instead but it may just be my ears. If they fit for you, you'll love them but just not for me.  "

Got a couple months out of em but not great.I'm no audiophile but these sound great. Very lightweight and comfortable. Stay in my ears. I have only a few minor gripes that are hardly justified at the price point:1. Lack of any water or dust resistance.2. The app is very barebones and lacks features. ie. No option to emit a loud noise from the earbuds when misplaced.Otherwise, I love these for the price and highly recommend them.  "

Small with great sound and noise canceling.My issue is with the oval shape of the speakers. Basically you can only use the ear tips provided and the ones provided are huge especially when compared with other products in this catagory. I would return this if I could because as it stands I can't use for more than a few minutes at a time.  "

Für die ersten 2 bis 3 Minuten war alles okay. Den Klang konnte ich noch nicht bewertet. Nachdem ich testweise durch Sh, Eh, und Heh gewechselt habe - das sind die Ansagen für ANC, Regulär und Transparenz Modus - ist der rechte Hörer in einer der Funktionen hängen geblieben und lässt sich nicht mehr bedienen. Auch das zurückstecken ins Case, sowie der Versuch die Kopfhörer nach Anleitung zurückzusetzen haben nichts gebracht. Schade.    "
