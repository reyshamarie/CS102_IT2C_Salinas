"1","Linsoul KZ ZS10 Pro, 4BA+1DD 5 Driver in Ear Monitor, HiFi Wired Earbuds, Gaming Earbuds, Hybrid IEM Earphones with Stainless Steel Faceplate, 2 Pin Detachable Cable (with Mic, Dark Black)  ","Qualbert","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 31 December 2021","4.3 out of 5 stars","        These are without a doubt some of the most impressive earbuds you'll be able to buy in this price bracket, even better than many that are several times the price.Along with a sleek and stylish cyberpunk aesthetic, these earbuds have clear mid-high tones and a deep bass that's surprisingly good for their size, as the ""music mode"" definitely enhances this. Connects easily to my Galaxy S21 and has no connectivity issues whatsoever.I'd highly recommend these to anybody looking for a brilliant pair of budget earbuds, particularly if wanting to use them primarily for listening to music.

It’s affordable, but the quality of it never lets me down. The sound quality is great and they feel comfortable in my ears. And durable too! I dropped them so many times but they still worked no matter what. Sadly, I lost the case recently and had to use my warranty, but the customer support was amazing! They helped me through every step of the way and got me a new product. I’m really thankful for them. The only complaints I have its that the battery doesn’t last too long, but if you charge them for a few minutes they’re good to go again. And the protection screens inside the earbuds fell off, but I believe that’s my fault for bad management. They worked just fine though, I just needed to be careful not to get water in there.TLDR: Great product for music and gaming, great customer support. Will be buying from them again soon, I definitely recommend. 10/10(P.S.: The pictures are of my new earbuds, the last one is of my year old one that I lost the case of. They still work though, so I use them sometimes!)  "

Once again thanks to the great customer service at black shark.Only had it for less than 2 months and it worked great the volume adjustment needs some work but the bass was good too until the volume in the right bud suddenly went down. Idk what happened I didn't drop it (the left bud I dropped but works the same) I didn't submerge it in water... a shame cus now I have to use only one bud cus of the volume imbalance but other than that these are great.
