"1","Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs  ","Danny Thompson","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 10 December 2023","4.4 out of 5 stars","        What I like are:-Fitting: the earbuds fit and stay secure on my ears even I am in a fast speed on my treadmill or the ellipticle machine.- Comfort: With the right size of the earplugs provided, I don't have issues with discomfort or pain caused by wearing the earbuds.- The sound: is clear and the bass is super strong. I need to reduce the bass level for certain songs. Stereo signals are good.- Noise cancelling function: appears to work when using with the app downloaded and installed to my phone.- It can withstand the sweat from my gym sessions.What I don't like:- Control button is not working in the way it is planned: I use the app and set up the button however the button on the left ear for switching among normal, noise cancelling, transparent works fine. However, the button on the right ears do not work even I keep pressing on, twice or hold. It completely does not work. I have to use my phone if I want to forward or go back to the music track. However I don't need this function when I use this earbuds.I have not tried the call function as I buy this earbuds just for my gym and I want to block the noises and just focus on my gym.Overall I recommend it based on its value and design and the functions it offers  "

This is not a problem for me when training as I hardly ever skip back, but if you are using this elsewhere, I could see that being annoying.I have a cheaper pair for day to day use though, so these get 5 stars as they are great for what I need them to do!

These fit (pun intended) my needs perfectly.The sound quality on calls is mixed and occasionally the Bluetooth can get disrupted if I have my phone in my back pocket, but mostly, this works as well, if not better than my wired headphones. I also love being able to change the sound profile when I'm listening to audiobooks as opposed to classical or pop music.I can't compare these to any others on the market because I wasn't about to spend more than this. For the money, I think these are fantastic.  "

Very soft ear loops. Easy to forget you have them on and zero chance of them falling out-sound quality is surprisingly good.-sound pass through suffers from wind noise so I turned it off. Not material for me, but something to consider-first time pair and no drop outs mid run unlike my earlier buds which would struggle with interference, say if you ran past a cruise ship at dock beside Sydney harbour.Very happy with my purchase and would buy again.

Ok... I just opened the box, inspected everything and tried these earbuds on for the first time.  This is what I found within the first 30min.First off, the Good!1. I had no problem linking/syncing these earbuds to my phone and have had no problem being away from the case. (Someone mentioned that they had to be next to the case for the earbuds to function properly in their review. )2. These earbuds are light and comfortable with the addition of the large ear pieces needed for my ears. The pre-installed mediums were to small, allowing the earbuds to fall out.3. The sound is crisp and clear.4. The case is small and sleek with the nice addition of a magnetic button pop lid and a seperate button that allows you to see the case charge lights, located at the rear of the case next to the Type-C charging port.5. The design of these earbuds is sleek and stylish as well with the slight addition of red and blue accent colors. Just enough to create a glamorous appeal to a potential, visually boring product.6. The button on each earbud is easy to push, however it may be hard for individuals with fat fingers/large hands. My only recommendation in regards to the button would be for Anker not to place it next to the over ear swing mechanism.The Bad!1. Like most pairs of Anker earbuds, the volume is very low, which is probably 60% of consumer complaints. I personally have sent back 2 or so pairs due to this issue alone.2. I had to download the Anker app just to boost the volume and it is still not very loud except for certain tones.3. The physical box these came in, the description on the Amazon site, Anker site and all other retail sites, indicate that these earbuds have ""Body-Moving Bass via a Dynamic Acoustic System"". I think it should say... Ear-Puncturing Treble if you want to be able to hear music outside of a quiet place! Where is the Bass that you so proudly suggest these earbuds posses?Without the volume at the very highest level I could possibly get it to be (alone with nothing making noise in my home), the music sounds clear and crisp but still has barely any bass. When the volume is at the highest level, all you hear is Treble for the most part and certain tones could almost be considered ear drum piercing.4. The piece that hangs over the front upper part of your ears are flimsy and short, with absolutely no way to mold them to your ears, making them pretty much useless. Even with the large ear inserts installed for my ears, I can still shake these out of my ears like any regular pair of earbuds (without an over ear hook), with very little effort.Overall, the price was not a bank account killer and they are initially, way better than Ankers Spirit X2, which I immediately sent back and later recieved an apology from Anker for. I have no idea how the Anker AeroFit's are and probably never will, due to the price. I will probably buy a pair of the Beats instead of spending only $20 to $30 less, for a potential letdown from Anker. I will update this review as necessary as I continue utilizing and testing them out.  "
"24","Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs  ","Arek","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 9 February 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","        I quite like the Anker Soundcore Sport X10.  This product is far from perfect, but it's pretty good overall.  It's a bargain at this price point, but has some annoyances.For music, these earbuds are excellent.  They have good bass and should satisfy most music listeners.  Volume is plenty loud.When it comes to ANC, these earbuds aren't that great. It's just ok.  ANC does work, but it's probably only able to eliminate about half the background noises when you're lstening to music unless you've increased the sound volume.When making or receiving phone calls, the mic performance is generally adequate. it's not going to win any awards but it gets the job done.  Indoors it's more than fine.  Outdoors, the mic performance is fine if there aren't too many cars around, but on a more windy day, the the mic sometimes struggles.  Background noises do get filtered out, but only to a certain extent.  Most of the times, it's fine, but callers will know that you're outside while in a call when you're using these earbuds.The control buttons are pretty bad.  I don't think that anyone will want to use these.  They are too small to be of any use and the ear hooks get in the way.  It's easier to just control everything earbud related from your phone.The ear hooks are an annoyance, but you'll probably get used to them.  Depending on how tight of a fit you get, usage of these earbuds may be possible without needing to fold out the hooks.  Unfrotuantely, the hooks aren't dettachable.  Also, I didn't find these earbuds to be as comfortable as Anker would have customers believe and did notice some soreness after using these for a few hours.Battery wise, the earbuds are a disappointment. The battery life is actually okay, but once again, Anker greatly exaggerates by advertising 8 hours of battery life.  While some other manufactuers give more realistic battery estimates, I've found that Anker markets numbers that aren't even close.  I would say to only expect about 5 hours of battery out of these.I rated this product as an overall 3 out of 5 stars. It's actually better than that, but it's not qutie a 4 star product becasue of some of the negative aspects.  It's more like a 3.5 star item.  "

Granted this aren't particularly expensive but when comparing the quality of sound to ¬£20/¬£30 cheap chinese ear buds, are they worth the extra money.. I am not too sure.The equaliser app is a great option and does make a big difference to the overall sound quality. HOWEVER, for some ridiculous reason, you cannot use it unless BOTH ear buds are out!? It just means I have to have a loose ear bud in my pocket, which will undoubtedly get lost in the not-too-distant future.For me, I rarely have both buds in as I like to be able to hear traffic when running. I really do not understand why this is the case but seems bonkers.  "
"30","Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs  ","Peter Beamish","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 2 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile but it's also not my first rodeo when it comes to sound quality. I own the Shure SE846's, I own Sennheiser 598/600/650's with a dedicated amp and dac. I also own the Sony WF-1000 XM4s and have owned the Jaybird Vistas, used the Jabra Elite 7 Pros, owned Samsung galaxy buds, tried the Shokz bone conduction headphones. You get the point. This isn't to brag about an extensive collection, moreso to at least lend some credence to my rating. I've been around the block when it comes to audio.Summary:These earbuds feel about right for what you're paying for. Which means what it means. You're going to get earbuds that stay in, can be abused, and have decent sound quality. They're nothing special as in it's not like you're getting a hell of a deal on sound quality or active noise cancelation, but, they're just fine. If I'm being honest, maybe slightly overpriced, feels like they should be about 5-10 dollars cheaper at around 60 dollar earbuds. If you're invested into sound quality, definitely look at earbuds in a higher price range. I wish I could recommend other earbuds in this price bracket but these are the only ones I've purchased around this price point. Do I regret my purchase? A little bit, but, once I've gotten into my workout I don't necessarily need the best of the best in sound quality, that's what I have my other headphones for.Audio:The audio is fine. It's bass heavy, but that's literally part of the item description. Messing with the EQ doesn't remove the muddiness of the sound. I'm more of a guy who enjoys pronounced mids and clear highs with crispy bass so these are definitely not my kind of ear bud. Yet, for the price, it's not bad. Not fantastic, but not bad.Build Quality:These feel kind of cheap for their price point. Not to the point where I'm scared to abuse them, more the case and and charging magnets. It feels like an after thought. Although I do enjoy the click open cover. I think if they had to skimp on quality to keep the price low they picked the best place to do it since you're not going to be listening to music with a case lol. The magnets do feel pretty weak like they might not create a proper connection if the earbuds aren't seated correctly, but not weak enough that it would be a frequent issue if ever. Maybe like a rare occurrence or something that would happen after a few years of owning these.Noise cancellation:It's pretty bad. If you're looking for ANC capable earbuds, you're not gonna find it at this price point. Feels like it's just added on in order to claim they have ANC since if you don't have that nowadays you're not competitive. So, on paper they have ANC, in reality you'll just be hearing external noises through a compressed mic if you're looking to only use the ANC function of these. In conjuction with music? To be honest, just keep the ANC off it'll save battery life and won't make a difference. The physical seal of the earbuds is good enough to where ANC isn't needed. The difference is laughable, they'd be better off not having added the feature, but I get it. Marketing.  "

"36","Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs  ","Matthias S.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 5 August 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","      Halle,Ich bin seit heute ein Besitzer dieser In ears und m√∂chte hier mit euch meine bisherigen Erfahrungen teilen, die ich sp√§ter nochmal vorf√ºhren werde. Zuerst kommt die Verarbeitung: Plastik ohne irgendwelche Gummibeschichtungen, aber f√ºhlt sich jetzt nicht billig an. Der Deckel vom Case ist transparent ( was 0 Vorteile bringt), ist leicht gefedert und √∂ffnet sich beim Dr√ºcken auf den Button vorne, der in hochglanz gehalten ist und die 3 LEDs beim Schlie√üen und √∂ffnen anzeigt. Das Case ist nur einbisschen gr√∂√üer, als das der Soundcore life a 1 und ein kleines St√ºck gr√∂√üer als das der Soundcore a3i. Die In ears sind gut verarbeitet, der B√ºgel besteht ist einer Gummischicht und muss von Innen nach au√üen am Soundcore-Logo entlang gedreht werden. Die Kopfh√∂rer haben soeine leicht kurvige Form, weswegen man sie leicht ins Ohr einsetzen kann. Die Buttons sind seitlich oben (wenn man die in ears im Ohr hat) und lassen sich m√§√üig dr√ºcken. Es liegen 4 zus√§tzliche Siliconaufs√§tze bei und ich musste die Gr√∂√üten nehmen, obwohl mir f√ºr gew√∂hnlich die mittleren (M) passen. Ich bin Metalhead und Kraftsportler und bei mir fallen die nicht aus dem Ohr (soll schon was hei√üen........). Sound: gut, aber leise.Mein Tipp: Alles beim EQ in der App ganz hochschrauben und gegebenenfalls Lautst√§rke etwas erh√∂hen. Die App hat viele Funktionen (Equalizer, Steuerung, Atmung, Umgebungsger√§usche. Die Umgebungsger√§usche bringen sogut wie nichts. Habe mit in ears in den Ohren den Wasserhahn voll aufgedreht. Bei normal klingt es voll und dumpf, beim ANC klingt es genauso laut aber h√∂her (rauscht st√§rker) und beim Transparenzmodus klingt es in etwa so, wie bei normal nur nicht so dumpf (offener, als w√§ren die in ears durchl√§ssig). Ich hoffe, ihr habt es einigerma√üen verstanden. Der letzte Punkt: Die Microphones sind auch gut .Fazit:Negativ: leiser Sound (l√§sst sich aber beheben(, die zu kleinen Silikonaufs√§tze und die Umgebungsger√§usche, ab und zu verzehrtes Klangbild. Neutral: Verarbeitung, ANC, Druckkn√∂pfePositiv: Ohrhacken, Deckel mit Federung, Knopf zum √ñffnen des Deckels, App, Sound nach Regulierung, Micros. Ein St√ºck ist abgebrochen, obwohl sie nie bei mir runtergefallen sind, was f√ºr schlechte Qualit√§t steht. Ich will einen Ersatz.Noch was f√ºr die, die andere In ears von Soundcore besitzen: Der Vorteil dieser In ears sind nur die Hacken. H√§tten die Soundcore a3i wings, B√ºgel oder Hacken, h√§tte ich mir diese hier nicht geholt. Wenn ihr die Gelegenheit habt, irgendwie an die Soundcore a3i Ohrhacken oder B√ºgel anzubringen, tut das und spart euch das Geld. Diese In Ears sind die UVP auf keinen Fall wert.So, ich hoffe, ich konnte euch damit helfen.Chapeau da daf√ºr und viel Erfolg f√ºr eusch, Spottfreundeüëçü™ùMal n kleiner Nachtrag: ich benutze diese in ears nun seit Anfang Dezember 2023 und hatte bis jetzt 2 Mal den Vorfall, dass die In ears sich nicht automatisch entkoppelt haben beim reinlegen ins Case. Dies hatte zur Folge, dass meine in ears im Case waren, ich auf dem Smartphone ein Video schauen wollte und mich gewundert habe, warum zum Teufel aus den Lautsprechern keine T√∂ne rauskommen. Des is ne absolute Freschscheit. 100‚Ç¨ UVP...........Soundcore! Ist das euer Ernst jetzt? Warum kriegt ihr keine  zufriedenstellenden In ears hin? Es ist doch so einfach..........laut genug, gro√üe und gute Tasten mit nem guten Feedback, die man nicht verfehlen kann, APTX, Wireless Charging und automatische Entkopplung beim Reinlegen ins Case und kein verzehrtes Klangbild. H√§tten diese in ears all das zus√§tzlich zu den Vorteilen, die sie jetzt haben, w√§re es mir ohne nachzudenken, 5 Sterne wert. Ich verlange Ersatz oder Geld zur√ºck, auf Grund der Verarbeitung und des Verzehren Klangbild. Ich bin mit diesen In Ears nicht zufrieden. Habe sie nur wegen den B√ºgeln. Eure Soundcore a 3i sind definitiv besser.    "

St√∂rt es wirklich niemanden, dass man wenn der rechte Kopfh√∂rer wegen Akkumangel eher ausf√§llt als der Linke, dass man dann mit dem linken verbliebenen nur noch leiser stellen kann, da die laut und leise Funktion auf jeweils nur einer Seite zur Verf√ºgung steht (linke Seite f√ºr leise, rechte Seite f√ºr laut. Sowas geht garnicht.Wieso wird von einigen Nutzern behauptet, dass er vergleichbar mit einem Apple Kopfh√∂rer ist. Wenn er einmal mit einem IPhone per Bluetooth verbunden ist, man das Ger√§t sperrt und dann zum IPad wechselt, wartet man vergeblich darauf, dass er sich mit dem IPad, mit dem er schon einmal verbunden war, erneut verbindet. Vielmehr muss vorher die Verbindung manuell getrennt werden oder eben Bluetooth ausgeschaltet werden.Auch wird nur der Ladezustand des gesamten LadeCases angezeigt und nicht pro Seite. Das geht auch anders. Also nix mit Apple tauglich‚Ä¶Was ich ebenfalls als sehr schlimm empfand ist die Tatsache, dass die B√ºgel 1. schwenkbar ( welches Ohr ben√∂tigt 210 Grad, damit wird sogar geworben) und 2. viel zu kurz sind.Durch die M√∂glichkeit des Schwenkens der Ohrb√ºgel wird das Ladecase kleiner und somit kann der Akku darin auch baulich nicht besonders gro√ü ausgelegt werden.Zus√§tzlich bedeutet es einen h√∂heren Zeitaufwand beim Herausnehmen und wieder hineinlegen (zum Laden), denn ohne die B√ºgel zu klappen, kann man sie nicht  an den Ohren befestigen. Einfach viel zu fummelig. Rein von der Anatomie des Ohres k√∂nnten die B√ºgel um Einiges l√§nger sein, auch k√§me das dem Halt am Ohr sehr zugute. Ich wage zu behaupten, dass jeder schlechtere Kabel gebundene Sportkopfh√∂rer l√§ngere B√ºgel hat, warum wohl‚Ä¶Der Druckpunkt der Lautst√§rketasten ist viel zu straff. Ohne dass man auf der Gegenseite einen Finger dagegen dr√ºckt, sind sie nicht bedienbar, ohne das sie weggedr√ºckt werden. Positiv ist die Tatsache, dass die Taster (wie bereits erw√§hnt, leider nur einer pro Seite) relativ weit herausstehen und somit gut zu finden sind.Da ich das Tragen einer Brille in Verbindung mit Ohrb√ºgel-Kopfh√∂rern bereits gew√∂hnt bin, haben mich die B√ºgel zusammen mit den Brillenb√ºgeln nicht gest√∂rt.Leider ist es mir passiert, dass der Akku der rechten Seite mehr als eine Stunde weniger Leistung zur Verf√ºgung hatte als der Linke. Somit wurde mir das Problem mit der Lautst√§rkeregelung erst richtig bewusst. Nat√ºrlich k√∂nnte man sagen, dass man ja nicht so oft regeln muss, aber wenn man nur eine Seite ben√∂tigt, ist keine Regelung in beide Richtungen m√∂glich. Welcher Exoerte hat sich sowas ausgedacht. Die Angabe 32 Stunden Akku suggeriert eine durchgehende Laufzeit. W√ºrde mich interessieren wie Anker sich das denkt, wie das gehen soll kann ich mir nicht vorstellen.F√ºr mich sind das definitiv Gr√ºnde f√ºr eine R√ºcksendung. F√ºr momentan 79,99‚Ç¨ h√§tte ich mir etwas Besseres gew√ºnscht.Vielleicht bin ich auch verw√∂hnt. Ich hatte zuvor die Powerbeats pro von Dr.Dre, die erf√ºllen alle Anspr√ºche. Lautst√§rkeregelung f√ºr laut und leise per Wippe auf jeder Seite, lange B√ºgel. Vern√ºnftige Ladestandsanzeige f√ºr links, rechts und Ladecase im Einzelnen. Ebenfalls einen ordentlichen Klang und automatische Neuverbindung beim Wechsel auf ein anderes Ger√§t Sie sind aber auch mehr als doppelt so preisintensiv. Ich wollte dieses Mal nicht wieder so viel Geld in die Hand nehmen und wurde sehr entt√§uscht.Qualit√§t hat eben ihren Preis.Ich hoffe das hilft dem einen oder anderen Kunden bei der Kaufentscheidung.

Maybe it's just me, but non of the ear tip sizes make any difference. The loop helps stop them falling off but not coming loose and letting more sound in. In the gym, a single shoulder press moved them enough to let all the noise of the gym flood through.Noise cancelling is a scam. The 3 settings just changed the eq settings, raising lower frequencies for NC, lowering it for aware mode. It doesn't work, doesn't make the slightest iota of difference.Volume isn't very high. I've had them on full volume at the gym to try and drown out the horrendous EDM they pump out but it's not quite loud enough. I don't have music on blasting so full volume is about as loud as I actually like it. Together with the non-functioning ANC, these perform worse in the gym than me cheap sets.Really regret buying these, would have been better off just buying a basic non-ANC pair for ¬£20. Waste of money  "

"50","Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs  ",NA,"Verified Purchase",NA,"2.0 out of 5 stars","        I run once a week for anything between one and two hours and was looking for a decent pair of earbuds that would loop around me ear to ensure they stayed in place, were waterproof to a decent degree and, ideally, had decent sound. So I went for a pair of the X10s which seemed to tick all those boxes and were keenly priced.All was well initially but after what I reckon was no more than 35-40 hours of use, one of the buds stopped working. I tried resetting them, everything I can think of, but it remained dead. I contacted Anker and their customer service was very good; they dispatched out a pair of replacements within a few days.So I started using them and all seemed fine. I picked up an injury so did not run for a few months, so when I next was planning a run I charged them up, popped them in and voila - exactly the same issue as I had had before with one bud working and the other one not, the same one as before on the previous pair.This pair gave me even less life than the first one - maybe 25 hours top - and are not useless. I can't find the box for this pair so I can't even contact Anker seeking a replacement, though not sure I would want a replacement now anyway.I own a number of Anker products and have always got on well with them, however this one is really poor and I would recommend you avoid.
