"5","TRUTHEAR x Crinacle Zero: RED Dual Dynamic Drivers in-Ear Headphone  ","Parker Jensen","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 18 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        EAR 1 (white):I had the nothing Ear 1s before, and liked the fit and design of them very much. The case was also fun to fidget with. I had issues with the noise cancelation, where it would always turn off or wasn't calibrated correctly everytime I put them in. The headphones would also lose signal every so often and go silent for a second.Ear 2 (black):I wanted to upgrade as I heard they fixed and upgraded a lot of the features.Noise cancelation: The noise cancelation now has a few more modes and keeps the setting you chose! A neat feature now is when you take one Ear bud out, it automatically switches the other ear bud to transparent mode until you put the other ear bud back in. These aren't quite as good as my Bose QC35 noise cancelation but do work quite well especially at the gym.Sound: After directly comparing these to the ear 1s, the sound on the ear 2 is noticeable better. The ear 2 also has a customizable EQ in the app. Music and audiobooks are clearer. These also don't have the issue of the first ear 1s where it would lose connection to my phone every once in a while.Ear buds: still fit great, comes with 3 bud sizes. They still look dope. The touch buttons have now been replaced with squeeze pressure sensors which remove accidental presses. They also play a satisfying feedback click noise.Case: still sleek, and fun to fidget with. Love the materials they used. Crispier edges. LolCost: The cost is reasonable, these aren't cheap but they won't blow the bank.Cons: here are a few of my only cons.- The noises when switching noise cancelation modes or connecting can be abrasively high-pitched/loud at times. (Wish we could adjust these)- Requires a lot of cleaning depending on how much ear wax you produce lol, especially for the case since you can see through it.  "
"6","TRUTHEAR x Crinacle Zero: RED Dual Dynamic Drivers in-Ear Headphone  ","Parker Jensen","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 2 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Vengo de usar unos Sony WF XM4, los cuales eran casi el doble de caros cuando salieron:-El sonido es muy bueno pero no es el mejor.-La cancelación de ruido es aceptable.-El modo transparencia es bueno pero lejos de ser perfecto.-Los controles no los termino de entender. Creo que el truco es presionar fuerte. Me gusta que son personalizables y hay muchas formas de interacción.-El rango de conexión es razonable.-La aplicación es excelente. Tiene muchas opciones de personalización y es estética y bien cuidada.-Son cómodos y no se salen.-En persona se ven mucho más bonitos que cualquier foto promocional. No puedo dejar de mirarlos.-La duración de la batería es adecuada.-La conexión simultánea a dos dispositivos es... Mucho mejor que la de Sony.Se que puede sonar a que no estoy completamente satisfecho, pero ajustando todo lo anterior al precio, y añadiendo puntos por estilo, yo los califico con 5 estrellas.    "

"9","TRUTHEAR x Crinacle Zero: RED Dual Dynamic Drivers in-Ear Headphone  ","Gael.dlc","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 11 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I have used so many earbuds over the years. They either had great sound but bad fit or great fit and bad sound. It's been so frustrating. I have a wonky right ear and every earbud (unless it had a wing tip) would fall out of that ear.Cut to......these Nothing Ear 2 earbuds. I recently started using the amazing Nothing Phone and thought I'd give Nothing's earbuds a try. Why not?Imagine my surprise when I put them in my ear and they felt secure and comfortable.....even my right ear! I didn't feel like it was going to fall out. I didn't have to futz with the buds. I put them in and they stayed.Connecting was as much of a breeze as the Airpods. There's an app for them.Let me tell you about the SOUND!.....After my delight at the fit I thought I'd be disappointed in the sound but I was blown away! Noise cancelling was great and the sound was so rich and full with great separation. Sound quality was right up there with the Airpods, even better I'd say. Such a relief!!Don't sleep on these! However I don't know how they'd sound with another phone. For not a lot of money it's worth trying.  "

In my opinion these are a 9/10.  "

"19","TRUTHEAR x Crinacle Zero: RED Dual Dynamic Drivers in-Ear Headphone  ","Román López ","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 16 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Tiene muy buenas especificaciones técnicas pero lo mejor es la experiencia que te generan con la app NothingX, que ajuste el audio de acuerdo a tu oído, la doble conexión, la latencia es casi mínima... Lo único malo que podría decir es que la batería dura la mitad si usas todas las funcionalidades, pero si aprendes a usar cada una de ella en el momento que se deben usar y no tenerlas encendidas siempre la batería fácilmente dura un 80% del máximo, sin empargo como tienen carga rápida tampoco es tan grave ya que en 10 min tienes carga de nuevo para varias horas.

"20","TRUTHEAR x Crinacle Zero: RED Dual Dynamic Drivers in-Ear Headphone  ","Román López ","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 14 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I love these because I've been looking for a good earbud to talk on the phone with someone at work. I work in a warehouse so I'm qllowed to wear earbuds while I work, and it can get loud, but the other person can hear me pretty well on their end! I also where gloves where I work, which has been a hassle with other earbuds bc their touch sensitive to change a song by tapping and I'd have to take my gloves off everytime in the past. But with these, there's no tapping! Which I love! It's a simple pinch movement on the earbud for all functions! And you can also adjust the volume in the app specific to your hearing, which I also loved because I don't like my music so loud, so adjusting all the features to my liking was nice.  "
