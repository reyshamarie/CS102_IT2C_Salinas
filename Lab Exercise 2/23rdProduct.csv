A budget deal for great music earbuds, just like the ""Momentum TWS 2"". The misleading(my case) playtime description is also just like the ""Momentum TWS 2"" as well. The lacking of ANC and transparent mode might massively affect outdoor users.Pros: GREAT sound signature&quality(TWS), customizable touch control, budget friendly to music listeners using TWS.Cons: 4hrs battery, no IPX rating, no transparent mode.Sound quality: 6/5Superior sound quality compare to almost all other true wireless earbuds. Very pleased sound signature that stands out from all other true wireless earbuds. It is not the best sound quality EARPHONES, but I doubt there is any TRUE WIRELESS EARBUDS with a better sound quality than this one.(Only heard the momentum 1&2 TWS might have better sound quality.)Bass quality: 3/5There is decent bass, just not for bass-head.Functional feature: 4/5Have all necessary features for indoor music listening. Customizable control feature could be very enjoyable for using experience.Bluetooth connection: 3/5Decent, not strong compare to others. Only used for music listening, not tested for lagging. Short pauses occasionally happens while playing l, last 0.3-1s each time.Fit in ear: 4/5Comfort in general. Decent secure fit. The size of the buds itself could be a little big, no issue for long time wearing, not recommended for activities with head movements. A little slippery when holding with fingers on the earbuds, much better than the ""Momentum TWS 2"" on hand due to its square shape.Battery life: 3/5Decent but disappointed. Unlike its advertised 7hrs for playtime (50% volume), the playtime I tested barely passed 4hrs, could gain another 40mins when just listen to audiobooks. It could be a lemon, or 3, make it 5 if add the ""Momentum TWS 2"" experience to the list. The white colour I tried got me another 15mins compare to the 2 black colour I've tried.PS: The battery of the case could fully charge the both buds for at least twice for extension.Passive noise cancellation: 4/5Good seal. When wearing both ears, may hard to identify the contents of speaking.Budget friendly: 5/5Considering to the similar sound quality with Momentum 2 TWS, the current price is very budget friendly for music listeners who like to have a pair of quality true wireless earbuds.Purchased price: CDN$ 129.95Review posted: Feb 2021  "
"2","Linsoul 7Hz Salnotes Zero HiFi 10mm Dynamic Driver in-Ear Earphone, IEM with Metal Composite Diaphragm, Stainless Steel Faceplate Detachable 2Pin OFC Cable (Black, Without Mic)  ","Jendricio","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 11 February 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Habe einige In Ears getestet (im Preissegment bis 150 Euro).Diese Sennheiser haben den für mich bis dato besten Klang. Der Sound ist warm und schön voll. Höhen und Bässe sind nicht betont, so wie es vielfach bei anderen Headsets gemacht wird. Heißt: Wer (einen neutralen) Klang priorisiert, dem sind diese Sennheiser sehr zu empfehlen - vor allem für einen Preis von rund 100 Euro (Stand Februar 2021).Die Touch-Bedienung funktioniert sehr gut. Im Gegensatz zu anderen InEars kann man damit auch einfach die Lautstärke regeln. Bei vielen anderen InEars kann man die Lautstärke meist nur eine Stufe rauf oder runter regeln, hier geht es bei längerem Druck auf eines der InEars stufenlos.Es gibt kein Grundrauschen, was bei Podcasts oder ruhigen Musikpassagen stören könnte.Die Videolatenz (am Android Telefon) ist zu vernachlässigen (für mich kaum wahrnehmbar).Es gibt dennoch Nachteile:Mich störte, dass man nicht beide InEars unabhängig voneinander nutzen kann (der linke funktioniert nicht ohne dass man den rechten verbindet).Der Sitz ist generell gut und angenehm, längere Telefonate funktionierten aber ""mit meinen Ohren"" nicht ohne dass die InEars durch die Bewegung rausgerutscht sind.Es gibt kein(e Angabe zu einem) IPX-Rating (Spritzwasserschutz o.ä.).Und ""Neutral"":Die Spieldauer (sprich Akkuleistung) lag bei ca. 66% Lautstärke auf einem Huawei Android Telefon ein klein wenig mehr als 5 Stunden.Die InEars schalten sich automatisch nach einer Weile ohne Tonübertragung ab. Durch längeres Drücken kann man sie wieder anschalten (ohne dass man sie wieder ins Case legen muss).Das passive Noise-Cancelling ist gut (es gibt kein aktives Noise-Cancelling und auch keinen Transparenzmodus)Das Case selbst fand ich entgegen einiger anderer Reviews kompakt und relativ robust.Die Touch-Bedienung funktioniert nicht (wie zB bei den Airpods Pro) durch Stoff wie zB eine (sehr dünne) Mütze.

"3","Linsoul 7Hz Salnotes Zero HiFi 10mm Dynamic Driver in-Ear Earphone, IEM with Metal Composite Diaphragm, Stainless Steel Faceplate Detachable 2Pin OFC Cable (Black, Without Mic)  ","Michael Wexler","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 11 March 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Let's get the obvious out of the way: these buds are larger than you expect, and heavier, in part due to the 7mm driver (same as the more expensive Momentum line from Sennheiser)... but you won't care about the size or weight, because they just sound so, so incredible.That 7mm  driver does make amazing sound, better than any wireless earbud I've tried, and for around $100 at the time of my purchase, this has better ""quality sound / dollar"" than anything I've tried.But there are some odd design decisions.  The touch surface for the control on the outside of the big block is hypersensitive (even a quick touch from my hand can trigger a pause, much more sensitive than, say, Airpods Pro).  On the good side, you can control volume from these, but it's a bit tricky due to the sensitivity.  For all the audio quality, I found I had to set the volume higher with these than with other earbuds on both iPhone and Windows PC Bluetooth (in Windows,  go to Sound in the Control Panel (under ""Hardware and Sound""), highlight your headphones, click Properties, and select the Enhancements tab. Check ""Loudness Equalization"" and hit Apply to turn this on, helps a ton).  With the plugs in, your do get good isolation from the outside (so ""passive"" noise reduction), though of course, you now hear every breath and gurgle from inside your body, as you do with any sealed-ear device.  Even with a Bluetooth 5.0 connection (they support up to 5.1) on the PC, BT lag is still present; this is really evident watching videos and, to some extent, on video conferences.  The buds stick out from your head, and are heavy, so extended wearing became ear-canal sore, but never really painful.  The ear tips are silicone, but less flexible than from other vendors: I usually wear a medium in other earbuds, but it feels a touch large for my ears; the small felt too small.  I may invest in Comply Foam for the first time.The buds support SBC, AAC and aptX, which is nice for iOS or Android users.  Microphone quality is the usual: it's good enough, but not as good as Airpods Pro, and clearly not the primary focus of the buds.  It'll be ok, but expect to have to repeat sometimes, as with almost every wireless earbud out there.  Also, I missed the auto-shutoff from so many of the other modern earbuds; these just keep playing when you take them out (luckily, due to the hypersensitive touch panels, I accidentally pause when taking them out most times!).Also, an odd design choice means that the ""power pads"" where the buds connect to the terminals in the case is just rear of the earplug; this puts a ridged surface directly touching one of the folds of the ear.  If you push the earpiece all the way in, you are putting the one rough surface directly against your ear.  Sennheiser could have easily put this on, say, the rear-facing portion of the block and let smooth plastic touch the ear, but, well, they didn't.  You'll get used to it, but it's just an unnecessary design choice.Connection is quick with verbal feedback in the buds.  Battery life is as expected, and runs easily the 6 or so hours; the case can give another 12-13.  It takes longer than an Airpod Pro to recharge; it's worth charging over a longer break than just the few minutes other products can charge in.  The case has a USB-C plug, but the included cable is tiny; throw a normal length one in your cart when you buy this.  The case has no wireless charging ability, oh well.  The case is larger than expected, a little heavier than an Airpods Pro case, and due to it's rectangular shape and width, a bit pocket un-friendly.  The top does have a hinge-helper which holds the top open, something more cases should try.Sennheiser has an app for iOS and Android, and it really is necessary.  It allows a firmware update to 2.13.0 that substantially improved connection speed.  You can customize almost all the tap patterns; I added ""play pause"" to the right ear instead of just on the left.  It also lets you store different EQ profiles (just 3 bands, so a bit gross, but better than nothing; there's also a ""touch and slide"" interface but it's really just a layer on the 3 band).  The profiles are stored in the bud, and can be changed live via the app, even if you are listening to another source (so, using the phone to adjust the eq while listening to the computer).  The app lets you control the connections as well; like most BT devices, you can't connect to more than 1 source hot at a time (aka no multipoint), and switching is still manual (Apple's Airpods ecosystem is more automatic, and Bose has done a nice job of having 2 sources mounted at once and having easy swapping between them).These are not sport buds: they don't quite stay in all that well (in my ears) when moving and have 0 water/sweat protection beyond the usual (a bit will probably be fine, but during a heavy workout, these re not fully protected from salty sweat.)So, other than odd choices in where to put the power connectors, the large size of the main block, the sensitivity of the touch panel, and oddities of the eartips size, the sound quality is amazing, far better than I expected from a Bluetooth connection, esp. for the price.  Master and Dynamic has a similar pair that drop in price to around $100, and Yamaha has a nice pair around this price with similar specs, but after trying them all, I'm willing to put up with the odd design choices for that clean Sennheiser sound.

El estuche de carga es de un tamaño muy cómodo para llevar en el bolsillo del pantalón.Los cuatro puntos que me encantan de estos Audífonos son:La comodidad, la duración de la batería, la conexión sólida con el smartphone, y por supuesto, el sonido.Son bastante cómodos, casi no pesan, y te aíslan pasivamente del ruido exterior a pesar de no tener cancelación de ruido activa.La batería le dura hasta 7 horas sin interrupción sin tener que recargarlos en el estuche de carga.La conexión con el smartphone es super sólida. No he tenido ninguna desconexión o dropout durante la reproducción, aún si te alejas a más de 10 metros.El sonido es muy claro, escuchas detalles de los instrumentos que no se escuchan en otros audífonos. La tridimensionalidad del sonido, es decir, el espacio y separación de los instrumentos es impresionante para unos audífonos de este tamaño. Es lo más parecido a unos audífonos de diadema. Se disfrutan mucho viendo películas. Las frecuencias agudas, medias, y graves están presentes cuando los sacas de la caja, solo tienes que descargar la aplicación para personalizar el ecualizador a tu gusto y el preset se guardara en los audífonos. Los agudos son brillantes, los medios muy notables y los graves, créeme, no te decepcionarán, son super claros y profundos.No te los recomiendo para hacer deporte porque no tienen certificación contra agua. Si los quieres para este tipo de actividad ve por los Sony WF-XB700 (Que son los que yo uso para esto) o por los Sennheiser Momentum del modelo mas reciente, claro que a un precio más elevado.Se pueden emparejar hasta a 8 dispositivos. Solo tienes que abrir la configuración del Bluetooth, seleccionarlos de la lista, y se desconectaran automáticamente del dispositivo anterior.En las llamadas, el micrófono no es notable, pero es lo suficientemente bueno para realizar llamadas con el teléfono y te escucharán claramente.La aplicación agrega algunos extras como la personalización del sonido, los controles táctiles y las actualizaciones de firmware de los audífonos, que por cierto, tarda un montón.En resumen, si buscas como yo unos audífonos para escuchar música o películas sin perder todos los detalles con una gran sonido 3D, estos audífonos son para ti.

"8","Linsoul 7Hz Salnotes Zero HiFi 10mm Dynamic Driver in-Ear Earphone, IEM with Metal Composite Diaphragm, Stainless Steel Faceplate Detachable 2Pin OFC Cable (Black, Without Mic)  ","Sofia Gro.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 4 February 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I have been a fan of true wireless buds for a long time, but the sound quality is always in some way sacrificed. Mostly it's the restrictions of the bud. It can only do so much being that small.I have tried Monster, Samsung, SoundPeats, Meze, Marshall, Anker, and even Klipsch.Among some of the cheaper brands too.So firstly, I have to say I have small ears. It makes it hard for me to family review some of them because they won't fit in my ears comfortably... A poor fit may skew the proper sound I would be getting if they fit...The sound quality is 5 star. Remembering, they are true wireless buds in the moderate price range.I am certainly not an audiophile in the truest sense but I do appreciate and expect the best of what it can do and Sennheiser hasn't disappointed.The sound is crisp, I hear all the hinted instruments in the background that you should in those certain tracks.  The bass is decent, not too overpowering.There is an app that you can adjust the EQ to your liking.Now for you small-eared people; you're going to need to get silicon replacement tips that have the little moulded ear clip thingy to get them to stay in. They come with the standard plug-type. For some of us, this just doesn't work.You just know I'll be standing over the kitchen sink when one decides to pop out.(They are rated for water, but you know...)If you can find the right tip for your ear, they'll be great.(Those Samsung Live Buds have the weirdest, most uncomfortable fit for my ears ever!)The price is right, the product presentation is nice, touch sensors are very sensitive and the battery lasts quite well, which is always relative to how loud you have them up. But for moderate use, quite good; 5-6 hours. Charging time is reasonable.I have not yet connected them to my phone so I cannot speak to the call answer, etc part of that, but I assume it works well. I bought them for music only.I am pleased, and would recommend them.  "

Even more so for earbuds at this price range. But hey, its Sennheiser.  Also, by using the Sennheiser Smart Control app, you can really make these sound how you want. From high bass, to low treble you can really change a lot. It also has the codecs for many different devices so it will sound great on Apple AND Android devices.Mic is decent and never had any problems with people understanding me even on windy high speed bike rides. Touch controls are great and responsive. Just try not to hit them when scratching your ears! One thing to not is that the right earbud MUST be out for use while the left one can be put back in the case.Build Quality:While the case could feel cheap at times as it just made from plastic, its clear to see that money went into the earbuds. They are very well built and fit great for me. While I don't have the largest ears, I found that the normal size worked the bets. They also come with Small, and large size caps. I also recommend twisting the earbuds inwards for a tighter feel. They have stood in during runs, windy bike rides, and vehicles.Battery:Batter is great. I think it gets about 20 hours with he case. You can check battery by pressing the little button on the back. green for high, yellow medium, and red for critical meaning you need to charge very soon. I think you can get about 4 charges with the case but I've had these for about a month now and I've only had to charge these things about 4 or 5 times and I use them for hours! Also. charger uses USB CProblems:While I think these earbuds are incredible, I do have some things I think they could add. Given the price range, I think earbuds like these should have some form of a transparency mode. While I think they have the hardware for it, the software does not support it. Honestly, This is the only area I'd say these things were ""lacking"". Active noise cancelation would be very nice too for the price but sadly, it is not included. It does have passive noise cancelling and honestly, I don't know the difference.Overall:Overall? Awesome product. These things sound nothing short of incredible and they fit and are built very well. They allow for great customization of buttons and EQ. About as easy to put on as any other earbuds. If you are looking for high quality earbuds, these are it.  "

Aunque no son baratos. estaba acostumbrado a los precios infalados y calidad diferente. No me gusta los controles pero es dificil adaptarlos a true wireless. El sonido es nitido y se puede sentir la musica. Lo unico es que si estas acostumbrado a escuchar muy fuerte (muy mal) como yo, al principio querras un poco mas de power. Pero no es necesario, una ves que te acostumbras aprecias el sonido de forma muy diferente a solo escuchar como retumban los bajos (por eso el volumen alto). Puedes usar el audifono derecho solo, pero no el izquierdo. Microfono decente, bateria buena con carga tipo C, case pequeño, audifonos algo grandes, pero una ves que logras entender como se acomodan no hay ninguna molestia. Si te consideras nivel intermedio en audifonos y quieres apreciar un buen sonido, compralos, te van a gustar bastante.    "

I'm not expecting that level of quality from a set of $2-300 wireless units, but I don't put up with bad sound quality and I like relatively flat response.I've previously tried the Jabra 75t's and other, less expensive units, couldn't deal with the sound quality and dropouts.  I'm not a fan of hugely stilted EQ (the Jabras in particular had bass that was incredibly overpowering in a bad way).** The good **- Sound quality is great for a set of $200 earphones.  EQ adjustment was minimal to get them in the 'sweet spot' where I could hear everything.  Highs and transients could be a bit smoother, but everything is there and you can pull the things you want up/down vs just having to correct for massive problems.  Soundstage is impressive for something this small and (relatively) inexpensive.- Connectivity is miles better than I've had before.  I used to get dropouts riding my bike on other units (3 foot connection distance), and with these I can walk across the room and there's no issue.  Time will tell if this holds for other use cases, but so far so good!- Battery life is solid at 7 hours default, plus more with the case.  Longer than I'd ever have them in for in one setting, anyways.- USB C charger.  Love USB C and use it for most of my other devices, so this is handy.- The Android/iOS app is great and easy to use.  Relatively easy setting it up/getting it connected.** The not-as good **- Right ear only for solo stuff - doesn't bother me, and they explicitly tell you this in the instructions, but be aware of it if you're a left-ear only type person.- No ANC - I didn't want active noise cancellation, so up to you if you want it or not.  The ANC version the Sennheiser makes is $100 more, so up to you.- Slightly wonky firmware updates that take 45 minutes.  Hopefully won't have to do this often, so not a big deal to me.Overall, I'm very happy with these - I'd been waiting to see if they'd release a version cheaper than the Momentum Wireless 2's, and this has answered my request!  I'll update this review if anything goes haywire down the road, but so far these seem like a keeper.  "

Now you don't see the deal even on here or Sennheiser website. I think they don't even have it on stock.Well for the price, it does look big on my smaller ears. It stick out alot but I am used to it. Reason for the dimension, because the drive they put in for sound quality.For sound, this thing will blow most higher end or even like Jabra 75T out the water. Again go back to the thickness of their driver(sorry I don't know what it call), and you understand why. They invest alot into the sound quality.While we on sound, I can't be sure how the real performance for the noise cancellation. Once you get the volume high enough, everything all disappeared.Product overall, once downloading their app, you can customize how to program their touch display for either side. Which, other high end don't do.Con, to connect the the earpiece to your device, so far I manage to get the right only. I try doing the left earpiece but could never connect. Which I am fine with.Call quality can depend on your service, I have people on the other side can and could alot of background noise, sort of like white noise. Call is excellent, making calls with voice commands are perfect. So perfect I manage to send text messages on my son phone for a test and every words came out perfect.I give this a try, but looking at the price now, $199. Is this worth the price now, no. I would upgrade for the Momentum 2. For some reason the sound quality on this model is much much better. You get other feature that isn't on the model(which you can research yourself).Conclusion, best if you got on the $99 deal. Perfect for everyday need. Oh forgot, on some videos from browser, there is a small, very small lag between voice and video. Isn't bad still. I think the update fix it a bit so that made it not too noticeable.Buy it, but another $50 or so, you get yourself the Momentum 2 and you can seal the deal with sound quality and many other features that isn't on this model.

Crisp sound, great battery life, nice features on the app, comfortable...they are absolutely outstanding.I've used Apple Airpod Pros, Galaxy Buds Pro, Pro Beats by Apple, Jabra 85t Elites, Sony WH-1000xm4s and other mid to high range earbuds and headsets and the sound produced by these topped them all. I realize its down to personal preference but these were my favorites.They've unfortunately died recently so I'm writing this as a memorial to them. I've used these almost every single day for around 18 months for anywhere from an hour to 10-12 hours a day. I've come to love audiobooks (and have consumed many within a day) thanks to these earbuds. Countless hours of music with Spotify, around 120 books from Audible read since these were purchased...If I were able to count the amount of hours I've used these earbuds since July of 2021, I would say these were worth the investment I spent.There is 0 exageration in my review, I've been addicted to these earbuds and I carry them with me everywhere.

They were pricey at $300 and I never felt like the sound quality was that great.  After the warranty replacements also failed I decided it was time to move on and give something else a try.The sound quality of these is night and day better compared to the Bang and Olufsen.  I paid $100 on sale rather than the regular $200 price, but even at $200 these are a much better value.  I am getting double the battery life which gets me though an entire workday with a quick topoff from the case during my lunch.  I also love the fact that the range between the earbuds is good enough to use only the left and have the right sitting on my desk or in my pocket.  With the B&O the right earbud was also the master, but if I pulled it more than an inch or two away from my right ear the connection to the left earbud was lost.  My right ear faces my office door so the added flexibility is nice.The ability to customize the gestures is great too.  I like being able to tap either earbud once to play/pause when someone comes into my office.The only feature these are missing that I had before is a transparency mode.  The B&O implementation was so awful that I never used it.  I don't miss it.  "

But,  I I had issues with them, where the left bud sound faded. I even had a pair replaced and they failed. Which forced me to buy a different pair. I have issues with how most Buds fit in my ear, I tried multiple pairs and was not satisfied with any one them. I was ready to give up when I read a review of best wireless ear buds in a tech magazine of the SENNHEISER CX 400BT and they raved about them for price.  I purchased them about two months ago, and I am thrilled with them.  They fit great, they have great sound and buttons are customizable. They don't have noise cancellation, you don't need it, they sound that good. My wife has the Apple buds and she has issues with home falling out, mine stay in all the time. They are great buy for the money.  "

Hands down the best pair I’ve ever owned. Crystal clear sound quality, excellent battery life, and surprisingly comfortable despite the boxy design. Touch controls are very responsive, unlike some other wireless buds that don’t respond half the time when you touch them. USB type C port makes charging easy and quick. Had them for almost a week and haven’t needed to charge them! The Bluetooth connection is strong, too. I’m able to walk a fairly good distance away from my phone without them cutting out. They connect quickly, too. Open the case and take them out, no need to pair or mess with anything. The only gripe I have is that the case is a little flimsy. The hinge of the lid is loose and feels like it might break if applied pressure. Other than that, excellent earbuds! I got them for $100 on sale, and for that price they are definitely worth it. Don’t know about $200, though. Personally, if I got to test them first, I would probably buy them for that price, but thats up to the buyer. 10/10 Would buy again!  "

These things are incredible. Perfectly balanced audio out of the box. I dl’d the app but haven’t touched it. Being in the music industry, I have to be able to hear all aspects of what I’m listening to. I only have Sennheiser over-the-ear sets for studio use and these are my first Sennheiser earbuds and let me tell you...these are little love buds for sound. I’d say equal audio to the over the ear sets. I’ve been in the hunt for some new buds and have returned several top names back due to not meeting my needs. As soon as I started the first track...I knew these were a keeper. As far as noise cancellation. I rated a 4 because I can still hear a little (very little) ambient noise when that ambient noise is at high volume while wearing these. Personally, I like that they don’t kill all outside noise cause I have to be able to hear when people are trying to talk to me. Oh, and only $99 for Sennheiser? C’mon...what are you waiting for.Stop the search...these are your ear buds.  "

The battery life is a bit meh but to be expected. I loved these and I hope customer service pulls through.Update: submitting for warranty is both wonky and to the point. I expected it to be a bit more involved but it was very simple once you find the correct site. There was zero human communication, which I didn't like. But they immediately sent me a replacement without any problems and super quick, which I loved.

Out of the box, they didn't sound like what I expected.  Especially after all of the positive reviews  At first it seemed like my JBLs would surpass the sound quality of these, but these just needed time to break in.  The firmware update was awkward, both in time to execute plus tying up the phone (couldn't use it to work out with another set of buds) At this point I was hoping the update would improve the sound quality, what I expect from this brand - and it did. Took a while, along with a break in period, perhaps 6-12 hours. After this period, these have proven to be much more detailed than expected.  The app is really what makes this purchase more than worth the money.  They did a great job on it.  I found myself customizing every song!  And it was fun.  So I came back to update this this review to give them the kudos they deserve, about 4.5 stars, rounded up.  "

These things are no joke. Sleeker profile in your ear than I imagined; I thought they would pop out of my ear a lot but not so much. The sound quality is really top notch. Bass is sufficient but the mids and higher ends are crisp. Sennheiser even has an app where you can play around with an equalizer and personalize a sound profile or two to your liking. No active noise cancellation but if you insert the buds in enough they do a decent job of insulating from outside noise. Battery life in total (factoring in case recharging) is really good too. Been using these maybe an hour or two each day for the last week and still haven’t had to recharge the case. Case has been all I need to keep these buds going. If you get these on sale, which I did, they’re a steal. Highly recommend  "

The firmware update after downloading the optional app took about 40 minutes, but you could still use them while it updated.I am still playing around with the sound through the app, but I like that you can do multiple presets. While they are not Active Noise Cancelling, they do block quite a bit of sound. They are not the flagship buds, but they have all the features I need.  "

Got them in the mail, popped them in and went for a walk. They do in fact block a good chunk of sound, 80%ish, but when I speak, it hurts my ears, like the sound comes out my mouth but gets trapped behind the earbud and just hurts.These earbuds have to also go worryingly deep. My previous pair, apple earbuds with the wire attached only had to go at the entrance, these earbuds really gotta get shoved in my ear, and it collects earwax, bacteria, and increases your risk of infection.Sound quality's pretty good though, I can hear all the instruments of my favorite bands. Solid earbud, not sure about the price.  "

I've used them at home, in big-city traffic and on public transportation, and they are as good as I hoped.  At first, the bass broke up and the midrange was tinny, but once I turned off the equalizer on my player and used just the bass/treble adjustment on the Sennheiser app, the sound was the best I've had from any earbuds. It isn't equal to a studio headset, but it's perfect for listening on my commute and taking calls. Noise cancellation is done by being sure they fit snugly in your ears, so it's not adjustable through the software and works as well as you'd expect. They are light, comfortable and respond easily to touch. I'm really glad I bought these.  "

It’s easy to power them on and off. They are also more comfortable than other noise-cancelling listening tools. As a small-framed woman who lives in a major city and often walks alone, I’m glad that they aren’t super visible. I’d prefer to not attract attention when I go for walks. The battery life is significant. I recall my first sennheisers needing to be recharged so much more frequently! I included my earplug in the photo for a size reference. I also appreciate the amount of bass. I’m a musician and I need bass.  "
