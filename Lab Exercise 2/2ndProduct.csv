"1","Linsoul KZ ZS10 Pro, 4BA+1DD 5 Driver in Ear Monitor, HiFi Wired Earbuds, Gaming Earbuds, Hybrid IEM Earphones with Stainless Steel Faceplate, 2 Pin Detachable Cable (Without Mic, Black)  ","Jimmy Mahjong","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 23 February 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars","        Very well tuned and an overall improvement from the first generation chu, to my ears.Moondrop has bumped the bass and smoothed out the treble, resolving the slightly metallic timbre of the first gen chu. I never had an issue with the amount of bass on the originals, but a lot of people did, this should fix that.These are now what I would describe as a slightly v-shaped sound signature, but it certainly still manages to remain articulate and engaging, very fun!Vocals are still a strong point, albeit maybe very slightly recessed compared to other Moondrop products (non issue), bass and slam is well controlled and treble has nice sparkle.No more spring tips included, just the standard Moondrop tips, and the nozzle now screws off allowing you to easily replace the filter. Moondrop filters are known to clog up with condensation/moisture resulting in channel imbalance, but I have yet to have this issue with any of my Moondrop iems, maybe I’m just lucky, maybe it’s worse in humid climates.If you do encounter this issue I believe either sucking on it lightly (seriously) or replacing/cleaning the filter will work to fix it for the time being.They also fit great in the ear. Like the chu 1, they’re small and don’t interfere, but don’t sit as flat as something like the Aria would.Remember, these are less than $30, have removable cables (a nice one too, imo), sound good. They make a great gift, too.  "

I am currently rocking philips fidelio x3, not the best but also far from a cheap headphone, as well as samsung earbuds pro and i've tested different headsets throughout my years, even really expensive ones at the airport :D. I enjoy a fun sound signature and also love me some ear vibrating bass.  This is my first time trying an IEM.With that out of the way, oh my god these IEMs are fantastic. This is as I said my first pair that I got and just wanted to have some earphones that sound fine when i'm at my laptop or travel somewhere. Their sound is fantastic, good soundstage where you can seperate all the different elements, super clear and very well tuned WHILE having a ear vibrating bass. The bass is awesome and right up my alley for the music I listen to. It manages to feed my above average hunger for bass while at the same time keeping the mids and the highs clean, separatable and just as good as the bass. The bass also has great separation and doesn't sound muddy and doesn't overwhelming the other frequencies at all. To keep it short, if you told me that these cost 100-200 euro, I would not be mad at all and probably still consider buying them. The fact that these are only 20 ish euro, makes it an insta buy in my opinion. As this is my first IEM, I can't really speak for the rest of the market, im sure there are better IEMs out there, but 20 euros is seriously a laughable price for this good sound quality.If you are on the fence on buying these, and also enjoy bass while wanting the rest to be clear and crisp and separatable, then I would strongly recommend buying these, you won't be disappointed. These really blew it out the water.  "

Para los que tienen dudas acerca del bajo, buen impacto sin distorsiones y sin opacar al resto de frecuencias, una verdadera chulada. Si me los pongo a ciegas y me dicen que son IEM’s de 200€, tengo serias dudas.Edit de 5 días después: todavía más convencido de lo que he puesto arriba; los uso para escuchar música y jugar a Valorant, y no defraudan en absolutamente nada, muy buena inmersión, los pasos se nota perfectamente de dónde vienen, y escucho aspectos del juego que con unos logitech de 200€ no escuchaba antes, durante más de 3 años jugando al juego. Sin duda alguna no voy a volver a comprarme unos cascos en mi vida, mientras existan cosas de18€ como ésta. Muy cómodos además, los llevas durante horas y perfecto.    "
"10","Linsoul KZ ZS10 Pro, 4BA+1DD 5 Driver in Ear Monitor, HiFi Wired Earbuds, Gaming Earbuds, Hybrid IEM Earphones with Stainless Steel Faceplate, 2 Pin Detachable Cable (Without Mic, Black)  ","bellcamp","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Sweden on 25 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Note: this review is all done with comply eartips, but the silicone tips included sound very similar if you can get a good seal.These things are amazing.. I picked them up after seeing Crinacle’s review of the original Moondrop Chu, and comparing other reviews between the Chu & Chu 2. The original Chu don’t have a removable cable, they have less bass, and a much more flat tuning which some may not enjoy as much for everyday listening. I listen to drum & bass more than anything else, so the decision was a no-brainer.Fitment: these are relatively small IEMs, so they sit almost flush with the outside of your ear, depending how deep you can insert the nozzle. That’s where one of the biggest complaints I have about these comes in. The nozzle width is massive, easily the largest of any IEMs I own. 500 series comply tips fit, but even the included silicone tips fit really tight around the nozzle. This means some people with smaller ear canals might not be able to fit these in as far as other IEMs. Otherwise they’re plenty comfortable, even when lying on your side to sleep.Build quality: they’re cheap, but don’t feel cheap like many chi-fi units. They’re apparently made of some metal alloy, but are still crazy light. They’re far from the flimsy garbage you’ll get with many KZ or other budget chi-fi brand models. Time will tell how they hold up, but I doubt they’ll see any damage beyond a few paint scratches here and there from tossing them into my bag.Sound: this is where things get crazy.. The original Chu scored so high on tuning that it was embarrassing a ton of $100 IEMs.. The technical capabilities fell short in comparison, but even then it’s far above what most would expect from something in this price bracket. Unfortunately I don’t have an original Chu to compare to, but from all I’ve seen these are more of a V shaped tuning. The bass is PHENOMENAL on these, which really surprised me. I’ve never heard sub bass this well done in IEMs before, period. I’ve listened to a wide selection over the years, from classic models like the Shure se215 (basically garbage now a days, frankly these outperform those in almost every way) to full customs worth over $1000. Nothing has hit me with this visceral sub bass. The best part is that it doesn’t muddy up the rest of the sound. The mid bass is still really punchy, and the mids stay well separated. The mids and highs are good, but not as crisp as I’d like. Comparing them to my Fiio F9 pro (dual BA for mids and highs, dedicated DD for lows) the brightness of the F9s really stood out, but they were also about 10x the price at launch. At the end of the day I have no complaints with the sound on these when considering just how ridiculously cheap they are, and have actually been using them above the rest of my IEMs just for that wicked sub bass.Accessories: they come with 3 pairs of silicone tips, which actually seem smaller than most (almost like they’re XS, S, and M). The included cable is fine, it doesn’t seem to tangle easily, and feels way more solid than the original cables that came with my F9 pros. They also include a little pouch that is serviceable, but a cheap zippered bag will do you much better for regular use.Overall: just buy them, you can’t go wrong for the price, and there’s really nothing else like this on the market right now. Unless you want to spend over $100, there’s no reason to look at anything else (aside from maybe the original Chu, but the lack of removable cable is a dealbreaker for me)  "

They sound great and have an incredible metal build while being light  and comfortable. Buy these. WtfThe Build:How are these $20… This is the most premium headphone I've ever opened and it was $20. They're insane. They are metal. They feel substantial in your hand, but light when you put them in they are so small and the fit is incredible, unsurprising for IEMs anyways, but I have some CCZ coffee beans that fit great but are bigger so don't enter as deeply, so these definitely take the cake.They have a leather pouch which is Primo, and not what I was expecting (I didn't see any pics beforehand).The eartips are pretty standard (no foam) and do a good job blocking out the outside world, it’s no active noise canceling and I’ve used better passive, but again they’re 20 bucks.The cable is a bit thinner than other IEM’s I have, and they don't have controls or a microphone. There is a slightly more expensive version with a thicker cable and controls and a mic, although its’ USB-C? Honestly I like the cable, it's light and more out of the way, and if nothing else I’ll just use a different cable from another set of IEM’s.The Sound:They sound excellent. I do think that the mids and highs are a little darker than I'm used to, but it's nothing that I couldn't fix myself with an EQ. They’ve very detailed, I'm running them with the BTR 5 and with Wavelet on and they sound pretty crisp. They're not the most clean I've ever heard, but definitely up there, and ESPECIALLY for $20. I do wish they were treblier, but I’m being picky at that point.I listened to a FLAC of AM by the Arctic Monkeys and they sound real good.I’m not sure what else to say about the sound, it’s dark and bassy, but it's nice and smooth; it’s unlike the bass outta some headphones I’ve tried.They do get loud. I've been listening to them at 60 percent without issue, they do get too loud at about 85 percent, if you’re into that sort of thing.The Music:FLAC - AM by Arctic MonkeysFLAC - Discovery by Daft PunkFLAC - IGOR by Tyler, The CreatorSpotify - I Need to Start a Garden by Haley HeyndrickxSpotify - Locket by CrumbSpotify - Various songs by MitskiThe Conclusion:I'm definitely going to be daily driving them at least for a bit, and again just an incredible package for 20 bucks (I'm excited for the leather pouch). I’m thinking these will be a great gift for friends.The Waifu:Excellent, my wife likes pandas lol  "

All my other IEM’s are currently not in use. In my opinion these earphones sound like they cost between 80,- and 120,- euro or even more, sounding better then my KZ PR1 Pro, Hidisz MS2 and Hidisz MS3 that cost about 5 times more than the Chu 2.I strongly recommend the Chu 2, no need to buy more expensive earphones.

Die Meinungen über kpop gehen auseinander, aber jeder sollte der Meinung sein das nichts auf so einem Headset gut klingt.Ich habe also, als ein guter Freund, etwas recherchiert und bin auf die Chu II gestoßen. Der Reviewer Crinacle hatte ihnen drei von drei Sternen für Preis Leistung und ein B+ für Klang gegeben. Klang also ganz gut. (kleiner Scherz)Auch die Tatsache das die Gehäuse aus Metall und die Kabel und soweit ich verstanden habe auch die Filter abnehmbar sind, fand ich in Hinblick auf Langlebigkeit sehr gut. Nicht viel ist nerviger als ein Kopfhörer mit kaputtem Kabel. Die hier verwendeten Kabel scheinen einem Standard zu folgen und sind dementsprechend einfach zu ersetzen.Der Versand kann aus China und ich muss zugeben, dass ich ein paar mal schon geglaubt hatte, dass das Paket verloren gegangen war, als das tracking den dritten Tag in Folge sagte das Paket wäre immer noch beim einladen in ein Flugzeug in China. Aber es kam rechtzeitig an.Wegen dem geringen Preis hatte ich mich dagegen entschieden es zum Weihnachtsgeschenk zu machen, sondern war zum Nikolaus umgesprungen. Im Nachhinein hätte ich auch ohne Probleme beim Weihnachtsgeschenk bleiben können.Angefangen bei der Packung wirkt alles nach einem Premium Produkt. Die kleine fast schon für Schmuck geeignete Schachtel ist scharf und sauber mit dem kleinen Panda waifu bedruckt. Die Rückseite zeigt stolz die Frequenzkurve die mir als Laien wenig sagt aber durchaus geschätzt wird.Die IEMs selbst sind in Schaum eingebettet und wirken durch ihr Gewicht und metallisch kühle Oberfläche durchaus wertig.Als Neuling zu IEMs die nicht gratis zu einem Handy dazu kommen kann der Anschluß des Kabels etwas verwirrend sein, aber die beiliegende Anleitung erklärt dies ausreichend gut. Erstaunlicherweise ohne die üblichen Grammatik und Wort Fehlern üblich für günstige Elektronik aus China.Es hätte mir also ohne Probleme jeder abgenommen wenn ich an Heiligabend gesagt hätte das dies gerade so mit drei Coupons in unser 50€ Geschenk Budget rein gepasst hätte.Aber jetzt mal das wichtigste, der Klang.Sie klingen besser als sie jedes Recht haben.Die hohen Töne kann ich noch so gerade verstehen, aber wie diese kleinen Dinger es hin bekommen ernsthaften Bass zu erzeugen verstehe ich nicht.Ich habe kein Ohr dafür zu sagen ob das was man da hört Hifi oder wie vom Künstler beabsichtigt ist, aber ich kann sagen das es gut klingt.Ich bin mir sicher, dass die meisten Leute mit der hier gebotenen Klangqualität mehr als zufrieden sind.Nur für Sport im Freien sollte man sie nicht verwenden. Wenn die Teile im Ohr sind schirmen die alle anderen Geräusche ab. Steht auch tatsächlich auf dem Beipackzettel.    "
"18","Linsoul KZ ZS10 Pro, 4BA+1DD 5 Driver in Ear Monitor, HiFi Wired Earbuds, Gaming Earbuds, Hybrid IEM Earphones with Stainless Steel Faceplate, 2 Pin Detachable Cable (Without Mic, Black)  ","gilberto dominguez","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Poland on 8 January 2024","2.0 out of 5 stars","        I'm surprised to see some rather mediocre reviews re these Chu 2s as I found them to be clear, open (for IEMs), have good soundstage (for IEMs), have no overwhelming bass or treble, no treble splash, no noticeable straining at higher volumes, no over or under presentation of male or female singers & a good balance between instruments & voices. They are also easy to drive.The earphones are very well made using zinc alloy (completely I think) & are a steal at £19.  They are very compact, lightweight & not at all bulky - diminutive. However, their sound is not hampered by their physical size.  The unique aluminium/magnesium diaphragm used seems to have made a big positive difference to the overall sound.I didn't use the cable that came with the phones - instead I used a reference one & this proved that the Chu's are worthy of upgrading the cable if you want to improve sound quality.  These probably aren't for those who consider themselves baseheads but will suit those looking for good sound accuracy & a balanced sound.  In my opinion, they're worthy successors to the original Chu's.  Recommended  "
"19","Linsoul KZ ZS10 Pro, 4BA+1DD 5 Driver in Ear Monitor, HiFi Wired Earbuds, Gaming Earbuds, Hybrid IEM Earphones with Stainless Steel Faceplate, 2 Pin Detachable Cable (Without Mic, Black)  ","Fabrice Leger","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the Netherlands on 25 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I will be comparing these Chu 2s ($19) to the original Chu's ($20-22), the Tanchjim Zero's ($15-16), and my Gen 2 Airpod Pros ($200-250). I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I do enjoy hunting for great affordable sound under $40 and comparing the results. I tend to prefer headphones that have a more flat and balanced sound, in short nothing that has too much added bass.THE SOUND QUALITY:The highs and mids sound on par with the original Chu's and the Zeros (which I found traded blows in sound quality, I couldn't crown one better than the other). Vocals and instruments in that range are very clean, clear, and pleasant. Where these differentiate from its predecessors are in the bass and lows. The sound feels more impactful while not being overbearing or muddy. It has a little more flavor than a balanced flat sound signature but it doesn't overdo the lows. The original Chu's and the Zeros can feel a little lifeless on bass-heavy/prominent songs so I would tend to switch to my AirPods when listening to those types of songs. With the Chu 2s I don't feel that need. The bass feels on par with the Airpod Pros 2 (which is fairly clean) while the highs and mids sound better and clearer in my opinion. The bass sound profile isn't exactly the same as the AirPods, but the difference is too small for me to be able to put into words how they differ.Overall, if I want to use a pair of headphones with the best sound quality capable of listening to any genre of music then I would use the Chu 2s over my daily driver Airpods Pro Gen 2. Otherwise, if I specifically want to decrease the emphasis on the bass for a particular song then I may switch to the Zero's or original Chu's.THE TIPSPersonally, I prefer the white Spring Tips ($13 after market for a single size) that come with the Original Chu's. They are slightly more comfortable and way easier to remove than the ones included with the Chu 2s. The Chu 2s tips are nothing special. They are not bad, but they aren't note worthy either. The Zero's come with similar tips to the Chu 2s, but with way more options in terms of shape and size. You are pretty much guaranteed to find a size that fits well if you get the Zero's. The Zeros also have various size diameters in the hole which I assume is to achieve different sound signatures, but my ears are not sensitive enough to pick up on any changes. I included an image that showcases all the tips included with each pair.THE CABLE AND FITThe Chu 2s win this hands down in my opinion. First off its removable so its easy to replace. It also has a firm soft plastic around where it grips on your ear which makes it obvious on how these are meant to be worn and are quite comfortable. This cable helps negate the downgrade in the tips. It comes with a right angle audio jack. If that doesn't work for your device then you can always swap the cable.The original Chu's had a comfortable fit without the included rubber guide, but selecting the microphone option definitely degraded the comfort for me. The rubber used on the cable could be a little unrully at times. This also has a right angle audio jack.The Zeros are the lightest being all plastic and thus take a little longer to put on properly in a way that comfortable (they also lack an L+R indicator which doesn't help the process). This is the only option with a thin straight audio jack so it will work will if you need to plug it into a recessed port. This product definitely feels the cheapest (which it is by 20-25%) out of the three, but I wouldn't call it bad.REPAIRABLITYBoth the Chu and the Chu 2 have filters that can be replaced. You can tell they need to be replaced if the audio becomes quieter in one ear. A replacement set of filters will run you around $5. The Chu 2s also have the replaceable cable which makes them the clear winner in this category.TLDRAll the IEMs listed are excellent in this price bracket and hit well above their weight. The Chu 2s are the most versatile and sound great with any genre of music and are also the most repairable.  "

Die Höhen sind präzise, die Mitten gut ausbalanciert, und der Bass kommt kräftig und dennoch präzise durch. Das resultierende Hörerlebnis ist für mich persönlich äußerst zufriedenstellend, da die Chu 2 eine beeindruckende Klarheit und Detailtreue bieten.Ein weiterer Pluspunkt für mich ist der herausragende Bass-Response. Die tiefen Töne kommen kraftvoll durch, ohne dabei die anderen Frequenzen zu überlagern. Dies verleiht der Musik eine angenehme Dynamik und Tiefe, besonders bei genrespezifischen Tracks, in denen der Bass eine entscheidende Rolle spielt.Die Möglichkeit, das Kabel abzunehmen, ist ein durchdachtes Feature, das die Lebensdauer der Kopfhörer verlängert und gleichzeitig die Flexibilität erhöht. Das Kabel kann nach Bedarf leicht ersetzt werden, und dies ist definitiv ein Pluspunkt für die Langlebigkeit der Chu 2.Für mich persönlich sind diese Kopfhörer ein absolutes No-Brainer-Angebot. Der Preis von 18€ ist mehr als fair angesichts der gebotenen Klangqualität und der zusätzlichen Funktionen. Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist schlichtweg beeindruckend und macht die Moondrop Chu 2 zu einer klaren Empfehlung für jeden, der auf der Suche nach hochwertigen Kopfhörern zu einem erschwinglichen Preis ist.Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass dies meine subjektive Meinung ist und das Hörerlebnis von Person zu Person variieren kann. Dennoch bin ich persönlich von den Moondrop Chu 2 Kopfhörern überzeugt und kann sie ohne Bedenken weiterempfehlen.    "

I was scared of overspending looking for good quality for sure, but I say this was the best choice to make as I had no clue what I'm getting myself into. Highly recommend. Super neutral sound, extremely versatile for your EQ needs, I don't personally use any lossless files so I can't speak in that matter, but the instrument separation is impressive! Highly recommend.

These sound better then earphones costing over $200. I had to come here just to write a review. These sound almost like over ear headphones they have a wider soundstage then any other earphones. The lows are phenomenal and the mids & highs. These are perfection and they get loud. The highs are perfect not harsh or fatiguing at all, but still energetic n nice highs. Super deep nice lows, natural mids. They sound very full and big something you would expect from much bigger drivers like over ear headphones. Plus the build quality alone makes it worth the money, they are all metal and again better then earphones costing $200+. The wire is amazing and I would pay the money for the wire alone, its detachable and you can add in a wire with a mic or a balanced cable. Also comes with a nice high quality carrying case, some sort of soft feeling leather.  "
