The case was also fun to fidget with. I had issues with the noise cancelation, where it would always turn off or wasn't calibrated correctly everytime I put them in. The headphones would also lose signal every so often and go silent for a second.Ear 2 (black):I wanted to upgrade as I heard they fixed and upgraded a lot of the features.Noise cancelation: The noise cancelation now has a few more modes and keeps the setting you chose! A neat feature now is when you take one Ear bud out, it automatically switches the other ear bud to transparent mode until you put the other ear bud back in. These aren't quite as good as my Bose QC35 noise cancelation but do work quite well especially at the gym.Sound: After directly comparing these to the ear 1s, the sound on the ear 2 is noticeable better. The ear 2 also has a customizable EQ in the app. Music and audiobooks are clearer. These also don't have the issue of the first ear 1s where it would lose connection to my phone every once in a while.Ear buds: still fit great, comes with 3 bud sizes. They still look dope. The touch buttons have now been replaced with squeeze pressure sensors which remove accidental presses. They also play a satisfying feedback click noise.Case: still sleek, and fun to fidget with. Love the materials they used. Crispier edges. LolCost: The cost is reasonable, these aren't cheap but they won't blow the bank.Cons: here are a few of my only cons.- The noises when switching noise cancelation modes or connecting can be abrasively high-pitched/loud at times. (Wish we could adjust these)- Requires a lot of cleaning depending on how much ear wax you produce lol, especially for the case since you can see through it.  "

Tiene muchas opciones de personalización y es estética y bien cuidada.-Son cómodos y no se salen.-En persona se ven mucho más bonitos que cualquier foto promocional. No puedo dejar de mirarlos.-La duración de la batería es adecuada.-La conexión simultánea a dos dispositivos es...

They either had great sound but bad fit or great fit and bad sound. It's been so frustrating. I have a wonky right ear and every earbud (unless it had a wing tip) would fall out of that ear.Cut to......these Nothing Ear 2 earbuds. I recently started using the amazing Nothing Phone and thought I'd give Nothing's earbuds a try. Why not?Imagine my surprise when I put them in my ear and they felt secure and comfortable.....even my right ear! I didn't feel like it was going to fall out. I didn't have to futz with the buds. I put them in and they stayed.Connecting was as much of a breeze as the Airpods. There's an app for them.Let me tell you about the SOUND!.....After my delight at the fit I thought I'd be disappointed in the sound but I was blown away! Noise cancelling was great and the sound was so rich and full with great separation. Sound quality was right up there with the Airpods, even better I'd say. Such a relief!!Don't sleep on these! However I don't know how they'd sound with another phone. For not a lot of money it's worth trying.  "

Buena en un porcentaje bajo de volumen, ya que suele meter mucho ruido masa si se usa a más del 50 porciento.En general muy buena experiencia con ellos, para su uso diario los encuentro muy bien.

This is because these earbuds blow away anything in the same price range to the point where it's just competing with the more expensive brands. That should tell you everything you need to know.Sound quality is great! Noise reduction and passthrough is decent, just behind Airpods, but amazing nonetheless especially when considering all other buds in this price range don't have that at all.The app is pretty good, I would say the only downsides is the battery life which is roughly about 3 hours on the buds themselves.Other negative is the beautiful bud case with the clear lexan plastic isn't going to stay beautiful for long. While it doesn't easily scratch, it's going to get scratched up. If you don't care much about that then it isn't a big deal. The layout of the case is really nice, I love how I can just drop the buds in and the magnet pulls them into place.Are you going to get something better in this price range? Probably not unless Apple AirPods go on sale for about half off.  "
