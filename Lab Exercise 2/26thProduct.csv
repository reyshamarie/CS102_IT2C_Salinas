I wish the sound quality was better, but format  has its limitations.ANC is very weak. Hardly noticeable. ""Throughpass"" with sound of surronds with the mic is at the same level as ANC - poor quality to a point where it is rendered almost non practical.Overall - solid, qood quality product with format limitations. These will never compare to the full sized quality earphones, and even wired good quality earbuds. But they are very convenient for gym, running, etc.  "

They're very comfortable in my ears the case is soilid and not too big, the battery life combined with the cases is brilliant,the noise cancellation and ambient mode is good but not as good as others I've tried, calls are clear through them, gesture controls are very good and I like you can program them to suit yourself and at the time of purchase I got them at a very good price.

Firstly, they fit my ears 10x better than the other ones, and are significantly more comfortable. Sound quality is superior, which I have come to expect generally from Sennheiser over the years. The price of them is the clear drawback, as they are more expensive than other wireless earbuds out there for the most part, but if you can pick them up during a sale or willing to pay the little extra, they're totally worth it. No complaints from me.  "

I have used the Samsung Galaxy Bud Pro, Beats and a couple of others, and these have provided the clearest most reliable sound I have had on wireless earbuds.I highly recommend these if you enjoy your audio!The Active Noise Cancelation does work but doesn't really block all that much extra out, and for the battery drain, I personally don't use it.  I do like to have a little bit of background noise in public.  At home, or in a safe area, I have used it to get some extra depth out of the audio.The transparent hearing is ok, it works, but you can't adjust the level.  "

Ever so slightly a little bright for my 'preferred' sound.However, nothing the EQ (via app) couldn't adjust.Bass is good in the most past, slightly loose at times but again, 4.5 stars.  I have various over ear cans which I am comparing these too and wired in ear.  So 4.5 for a true wireless is pretty damn good.Would like a slightly higher volume capability, and the noise cancelling is good, but not terrific.  (Good enough).If you are interested in the MTW2 and they are on sale, grab em!(Always keep in mind though, music and sound is a personal choice, so may not be to your liking...)  "

Having owned some Sennheiser on ear ANC headphones years ago, I was fairly confident these would live up to their review rating. Functionality was A1, and the included app means you can tweak the audio to your taste rather than adjust your phone's global settings which then has to be readjusted in the car etc. Fit was fine for me using the tips straight out of the box. For audiophiles, you simply cannot beat the sound from a closed back earphone/earbud.  "

Pairs immediately and very comfortable with excellent battery life. Easily fits the ears, sort of locking in place with a half twist. Great little carry case which offers additional recharging of 4-5 times the original. I only gave 4 stars for comfort because I don't like ANYTHING in my ears and for value because they are somewhat on the more expensive side. Having said that there are less impressive earpods for more money so I'm very happy with the purchase.  "

Replaced my maybe 5+ year old momentum overhears, can't believe the sound is the same (amazing) but from these tiny little things. The noise cancelling is great too, even just for when your air con or boyfriend is too noisy in the background while you're trying to work. Worth every penny to me, glad I took the plunge. I use them multiple times a day. The literal only improvement would be pairing with multiple devices at the same time but that would just make them too perfect probably.  "

The pass though mode is brilliant if you want to talk to someone without removing the headphones.Battery life isn't a full 7 hours as advertised, maybe closer to 5 hours. but with the charging case you can go for quite some time. The bluetooth range is great,  can leave my phone on the desk and walk all over the house without dropouts.I'm not a huge audiophile, but the sound is pretty good whether being used for podcasts, music or phone calls.At the discounted price I'm very happy with the purchase, I would probably rate these more harshly if I paid full price, but all in all, these are a solid set of earphones.

The quality of the sound is outstanding for their size.  A pretty reasonable sound stage is presented, compares favourably to the Momentum 2 Over Ear headphones.  The noise cancellation is fair, but the buds physically block out a lot of background sound already with the way they sit in our ear.  I've tried a few different earbuds over the years (Apple, JBL, Koss) and these are by far the best.  "
