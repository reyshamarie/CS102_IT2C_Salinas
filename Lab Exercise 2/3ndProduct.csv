You sort of have to peel it back and pinch it to slip it on. The variety of buds provided is generous. And luckily, once you find the ones that are most comfortable, you probably won't have to change them again.Usually, in-ear headphones are very uncomfortable for me, but when I switched to the bigger buds provided, I find I can easily wear these for hours with no issue.Just a heads up, they do get very loud very easily.Sound quality is great though! Highly recommended!  "

Was not expecting much and at first thought they were OK but sound was a bit thin. I also tried them using my DAP Shanling C3X and again OK. But after about a week of use, they seemed to come alive with clear, transparent warm sound comparable to another pair of my more expensive IEMs. I play classical music from my stored library and from internet radio-ABC Classical. I am very satisfied with the performance from both sources.I plan now to purchase the Blue Tooth cable for more flexibility using these IEMs.I am sure that a balanced cable for my C3X would also be of benefit.Also they fit well in the ears and OK for extended listening.Great seal.One quibble was that difficult to see the L R marks on cable for fitting the buds.Highly recommended for quality sound at a great price.

They deliver, and they deliver well! Earbuds like ear plugs, meaning you don't need any fancy noise cancelling, as there's just no noise at all. Cable is nice but not braided like the ZSN Pro X model I have, which was a bit disappointing as it has a bit of memory and likes to coil up a bit, but with wear, it straightens out fine.Keep it up KZ!

Never knew about IEM's did about ten mins of research and was convinced that these ZS10 PRO is what I needed, I was not disappointed.It takes a bit of fiddling to get the ear plug that works for you, but when you do its heaven. A crisp sound with deep bass (I listen to a lot of edm, rock, metal, screamo and phonk plus the occasional 80's classics) and these produce sounds I've never heard before within songs. 10/10 if you're looking at getting a pair of comfortable earphones what are crazy obvious, you're wearing some which produce great sound, go no further.

Ended up with the second smallest, which are comfortable, and still seal the ear canals.I couldn't see a L or an R anywhere but figured the cable with the button is the right channel.Worked out which way around the pods go and plugged them in.I am listening to them through a XDUOO XD05 Bal DAC/Headphone Amp.Hard to say they sound as good as my $400 Sony WH1000 Noise-cancelling headphones, but they sound great, and I have no desire to change. They are truly a comfortable fit once you get the silicon earpiece sizes sorted. Also a lot less cumbersome to wear and not as expensive to lose as the WH1000 Headphones; and they fit in my pocket, although I'd probably use a pouch first.3.5mm plug didn't want to plug into the phone and stay but did snap into the 3.5mm to 6.5mm adaptor that plugs into the DAC.Well worth the coin.

If you are looking to buy these for everyday use and not professional use. Then you have found a decent set of plugs.... Now, you're gonna have other users tell you they are muddy, tinny, lack mid and even have overpowering mids.. let's face it, you're probably not even going to notice as a standard user listening to Spotify... If you're a professional and need them for specific work or whatever, then this isn't the review for you. All i can say as what i call a standard user/music lover they get the job done and done very well... Fit better then that air pods pro from a fit side. Do have some weight from the styling of the metal and the cable will question your ability to set them up.. The over ear cable also secured them well after i had to swap the way i put them together. Passive sound isolation is as others would be. Ear tips a comfortable. Cable length is acceptable. would buy again if i had to purchase another pair.  "

These are my first ever in ear monitor earphones so not sure if thatâ€™s a standard length hence I didnâ€™t take off any stars for it.Otherwise Iâ€™m happy with it.

The tone is warm and detailed, with the bass being round, defined and not muddy at all with decent low end extension.  I found myself skipping through tracks trying to find a genre that they would stumble on, but they're surprisingly well balanced.

I really hope they do.  "

These completely blow my US $1500 custom moulded 6 driver IEMs out of the water, as well as all my other leading brand IEMs. I am completely amazed at the sparkling top end, perfect amount of bass and slightly rolled back mids. For me, the default ear buds perfectly isolate the outside noise. I immediately bought a second pair as well as the upgraded cables. Using these now as my main IEMs on stage.  "

I wanted a new set of earphones (with a mic) to use for conference calls (Skype / Zoom etc) at my workstation. For that purpose these work great. I find them comfortable to wear for hours at a time and frequently use them to listen to music and edit video work.I was very surprised to hear the EQ difference between these and the AS10's. Both have more clarity and detail than anything I've used before, including $400+ Bose headphones. The ZS10's have a far brighter EQ than the AS10's (which are warmer and more bottom heavy, but not what I'd call boomy). The ZS10's have a lot of top end clarity and fairly tight/controlled bass. I boost the bass slightly on my SoundBlaster external interface. Switching between these two earphones is chalk and cheese, but after a few minutes on either I'm content.For 5 drivers per side, at this sort of money, this is hard to beat.  "

How much are these?!","Amazon Customer","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 5 April 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        TL;DR: How are these 20 bucks? They sound great and have an incredible metal build while being light  and comfortable. Buy these. WtfThe Build:How are these $20â€¦ This is the most premium headphone I've ever opened and it was $20. They're insane. They are metal. They feel substantial in your hand, but light when you put them in they are so small and the fit is incredible, unsurprising for IEMs anyways, but I have some CCZ coffee beans that fit great but are bigger so don't enter as deeply, so these definitely take the cake.They have a leather pouch which is Primo, and not what I was expecting (I didn't see any pics beforehand).The eartips are pretty standard (no foam) and do a good job blocking out the outside world, itâ€™s no active noise canceling and Iâ€™ve used better passive, but again theyâ€™re 20 bucks.The cable is a bit thinner than other IEMâ€™s I have, and they don't have controls or a microphone. There is a slightly more expensive version with a thicker cable and controls and a mic, although itsâ€™ USB-C? Honestly I like the cable, it's light and more out of the way, and if nothing else Iâ€™ll just use a different cable from another set of IEMâ€™s.The Sound:They sound excellent. I do think that the mids and highs are a little darker than I'm used to, but it's nothing that I couldn't fix myself with an EQ. Theyâ€™ve very detailed, I'm running them with the BTR 5 and with Wavelet on and they sound pretty crisp. They're not the most clean I've ever heard, but definitely up there, and ESPECIALLY for $20. I do wish they were treblier, but Iâ€™m being picky at that point.I listened to a FLAC of AM by the Arctic Monkeys and they sound real good.Iâ€™m not sure what else to say about the sound, itâ€™s dark and bassy, but it's nice and smooth; itâ€™s unlike the bass outta some headphones Iâ€™ve tried.They do get loud. I've been listening to them at 60 percent without issue, they do get too loud at about 85 percent, if youâ€™re into that sort of thing.The Music:FLAC - AM by Arctic MonkeysFLAC - Discovery by Daft PunkFLAC - IGOR by Tyler, The CreatorSpotify - I Need to Start a Garden by Haley HeyndrickxSpotify - Locket by CrumbSpotify - Various songs by MitskiThe Conclusion:I'm definitely going to be daily driving them at least for a bit, and again just an incredible package for 20 bucks (I'm excited for the leather pouch). Iâ€™m thinking these will be a great gift for friends.The Waifu:Excellent, my wife likes pandas lol  "

All my other IEMâ€™s are currently not in use. In my opinion these earphones sound like they cost between 80,- and 120,- euro or even more, sounding better then my KZ PR1 Pro, Hidisz MS2 and Hidisz MS3 that cost about 5 times more than the Chu 2.I strongly recommend the Chu 2, no need to buy more expensive earphones.

They are also easy to drive.The earphones are very well made using zinc alloy (completely I think) & are a steal at Â£19.  They are very compact, lightweight & not at all bulky - diminutive. However, their sound is not hampered by their physical size.  The unique aluminium/magnesium diaphragm used seems to have made a big positive difference to the overall sound.I didn't use the cable that came with the phones - instead I used a reference one & this proved that the Chu's are worthy of upgrading the cable if you want to improve sound quality.  These probably aren't for those who consider themselves baseheads but will suit those looking for good sound accuracy & a balanced sound.  In my opinion, they're worthy successors to the original Chu's.  Recommended  "

These sound better then earphones costing over $200. I had to come here just to write a review. These sound almost like over ear headphones they have a wider soundstage then any other earphones. The lows are phenomenal and the mids & highs. These are perfection and they get loud. The highs are perfect not harsh or fatiguing at all, but still energetic n nice highs. Super deep nice lows, natural mids. They sound very full and big something you would expect from much bigger drivers like over ear headphones. Plus the build quality alone makes it worth the money, they are all metal and again better then earphones costing $200+. The wire is amazing and I would pay the money for the wire alone, its detachable and you can add in a wire with a mic or a balanced cable. Also comes with a nice high quality carrying case, some sort of soft feeling leather.  "

I've always used earbuds before but the KZ ZS10 Pro are levels above in sound quality. Cable looping over ears seemed a bit strange at first but it holds them securely and makes them very comfortable to wear for long periods. They have a very balanced sound and you can hear an amazing level of detail and position for instruments and vocals. This is also helped by great sound isolation. I don't know how they do it for the price.  "

Crisp and clear sound at all frequency range. Bass is clear, punchy and not muddy or boomy. Simply well balanced with the highs. The mix of matt silver and blue line design is just sublime.Cables can be better. Tangle much.Took a while for delivery, it it stil came within a month.  I couldn't wait so, I ordered from another seller and it came within a week.  I continue to wait for this only because of the quality of the product and done mind having two of these mind blowing iems for it's price.Overall, still worth the wait and price.  "
