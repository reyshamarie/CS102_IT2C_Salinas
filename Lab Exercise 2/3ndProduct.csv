"1","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Haydn Malyon","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 26 January 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars","        Surprising value and great quality overall.Changing the buds can be a little tricky, but not too hard once you get the hang of it. You sort of have to peel it back and pinch it to slip it on. The variety of buds provided is generous. And luckily, once you find the ones that are most comfortable, you probably won't have to change them again.Usually, in-ear headphones are very uncomfortable for me, but when I switched to the bigger buds provided, I find I can easily wear these for hours with no issue.Just a heads up, they do get very loud very easily.Sound quality is great though! Highly recommended!  "
"2","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Dmitry Samokhin","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 20 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Purchased these IEMs for my phone when my Sennheiser CX 350BT Wireless In-Ear Headphones failed. Was not expecting much and at first thought they were OK but sound was a bit thin. I also tried them using my DAP Shanling C3X and again OK. But after about a week of use, they seemed to come alive with clear, transparent warm sound comparable to another pair of my more expensive IEMs. I play classical music from my stored library and from internet radio-ABC Classical. I am very satisfied with the performance from both sources.I plan now to purchase the Blue Tooth cable for more flexibility using these IEMs.I am sure that a balanced cable for my C3X would also be of benefit.Also they fit well in the ears and OK for extended listening.Great seal.One quibble was that difficult to see the L R marks on cable for fitting the buds.Highly recommended for quality sound at a great price.

"5","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Harry P","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 13 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Introduced to KZ via their KZ ZSN Pro Xs under recommendation of Dankpods (youtube), and purchased these ZS10s as a step-up, as the price difference is marginal and considering the ZSN Pro Xs were so good, what could possibly go wrong?The answer: Nothing. They deliver, and they deliver well! Earbuds like ear plugs, meaning you don't need any fancy noise cancelling, as there's just no noise at all. Cable is nice but not braided like the ZSN Pro X model I have, which was a bit disappointing as it has a bit of memory and likes to coil up a bit, but with wear, it straightens out fine.Keep it up KZ!

"8","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Fortnite Gamer","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 29 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        For the money - nothing compares. I was using shure 535s on a gig and was given these to try - I didn’t touch the 535s from that point onward and ordered on the spot. Vocal clarity, ability to determine pitch clearly, 5-7k boost, so good. I had my JH Audio 16s stolen and was going to purchase again, no need to now. Very impressed.  "

"11","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","OMN1","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 30 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Was looking for a comfortable pair for earphones to listen to music with a higher quality without the need to wear massive headphones. Never knew about IEM's did about ten mins of research and was convinced that these ZS10 PRO is what I needed, I was not disappointed.It takes a bit of fiddling to get the ear plug that works for you, but when you do its heaven. A crisp sound with deep bass (I listen to a lot of edm, rock, metal, screamo and phonk plus the occasional 80's classics) and these produce sounds I've never heard before within songs. 10/10 if you're looking at getting a pair of comfortable earphones what are crazy obvious, you're wearing some which produce great sound, go no further.

Sounds AMAZING. Simple not a lot of trash packaging. Very satisfied with the product. However, this is still new, so product durability is unknown. However, the feeling to the touch is definitely expensive.  "

"14","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Endro Wedianto","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 20 February 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars","        I followed the instructions and started with the smallest silicon earpieces. Ended up with the second smallest, which are comfortable, and still seal the ear canals.I couldn't see a L or an R anywhere but figured the cable with the button is the right channel.Worked out which way around the pods go and plugged them in.I am listening to them through a XDUOO XD05 Bal DAC/Headphone Amp.Hard to say they sound as good as my $400 Sony WH1000 Noise-cancelling headphones, but they sound great, and I have no desire to change. They are truly a comfortable fit once you get the silicon earpiece sizes sorted. Also a lot less cumbersome to wear and not as expensive to lose as the WH1000 Headphones; and they fit in my pocket, although I'd probably use a pouch first.3.5mm plug didn't want to plug into the phone and stay but did snap into the 3.5mm to 6.5mm adaptor that plugs into the DAC.Well worth the coin.  "
"15","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Daniel Gorgievski","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 4 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        They work, They're loud, They're clear (very Clear) and I think that they will go pound for pound with many of the other models out there with a much higher price point. If you are looking to buy these for everyday use and not professional use. Then you have found a decent set of plugs.... Now, you're gonna have other users tell you they are muddy, tinny, lack mid and even have overpowering mids.. let's face it, you're probably not even going to notice as a standard user listening to Spotify... If you're a professional and need them for specific work or whatever, then this isn't the review for you. All i can say as what i call a standard user/music lover they get the job done and done very well... Fit better then that air pods pro from a fit side. Do have some weight from the styling of the metal and the cable will question your ability to set them up.. The over ear cable also secured them well after i had to swap the way i put them together. Passive sound isolation is as others would be. Ear tips a comfortable. Cable length is acceptable. would buy again if i had to purchase another pair.  "
"16","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Neddy Spaghetti","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 8 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        It sounds great I can tell. I’m also biased because this is my first ever in-ear monitor, but if you are in the same place as me, it is a great choice. It can be a bit bulky when you put it in your ear, if you get to compare with other brands. But who cares? It is comfortable in my ears. :D  "

"18","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","MARCEL MEDINA","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 27 February 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I really like everything about these ear phones.I switched out the standard size earbuds to the smallest one as I have small ears. And it’s super comfortable and at times you forget you’re wearing it.My only complaint is that the cable is a bit too short for my needs. These are my first ever in ear monitor earphones so not sure if that’s a standard length hence I didn’t take off any stars for it.Otherwise I’m happy with it. Sound quality was great, already helped me fix some of my vocal and guitar mixing for my helix live performance presets.I do recommend the purchase.  "

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing and the bass punches way above it’s weight. I ended up buying another set as back up…totally in love with these and no one will change my mind 😀  "

They are still quite 'punchy' without that cheap sound feel from $5 headphones.Not as good as bose headphones or more expensive sony.Still much better than anything else at this price.The sound clarity I would rate 7/10.Found them quite comfortable.Would buy them again at this price.Decent degree of sound isolation.Gives an immersive feel to the sound that I find quite nice. Feels like the sound is in your head. Doesn't have that large sound stage but these are in ear so eh.They are now my go to headphones if I'm using them at home  "
"24","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Excellent earlier delivery and excellent product as well im very happ ","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 9 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Great product. Lived up to expectations as described in numerous reviews.My evaluation is based on listening to music tracks having a full range of the sound spectrum.Compared with other headphones, sound great.Have to be worn and inserted in the ear correctly to obtain the best of the sound characteristics these units can deliver.Yet to try on intended use, monitoring electronic drums however.Great sound for the price. Very happy with this purchase.  "
"25","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Excellent earlier delivery and excellent product as well im very happ ","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 26 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I wasn't sure what to expect when these arrived, but after playing around with the fit, it became pretty obvious these headphones represent amazing value.  The tone is warm and detailed, with the bass being round, defined and not muddy at all with decent low end extension.  I found myself skipping through tracks trying to find a genre that they would stumble on, but they're surprisingly well balanced.  If you're interested in seeing what these multi-driver IEMs are like without spending too much money, I doubt you'll be disappointed with these.  Whether they last any length of time, we'll see.. I really hope they do.  "
"26","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Jay L","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 20 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        The sound is incredible coming from HD Audio straight out of a motherboard. Super clean sound and so interesting to hear something so compact produce such a powerful sound. The high end is present but never over the top at all. Such a good tune from these guys even listening to super loud mixes. The clarity is insane moving from over the ear headphones that are more than double the cost.Cannot recommend these enough! Impressive!  "
"27","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Jack Sparrow","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 1 November 2023","4.5 out of 5 stars","        Comfortable, good sound quality across the spectrum. Bass level is dependent upon hwo well you seat the ear tip in your ear.  "

"29","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Nb","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 26 August 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars","        It may sound odd for something this inexpensive, but these so far are best sounding IEMs I’ve owned. These completely blow my US $1500 custom moulded 6 driver IEMs out of the water, as well as all my other leading brand IEMs. I am completely amazed at the sparkling top end, perfect amount of bass and slightly rolled back mids. For me, the default ear buds perfectly isolate the outside noise. I immediately bought a second pair as well as the upgraded cables. Using these now as my main IEMs on stage.  "
"30","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Christian Ramsden","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 2 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        My first KZ product was a pair of AS10's, which I loved and still have 2 years later. I wanted a new set of earphones (with a mic) to use for conference calls (Skype / Zoom etc) at my workstation. For that purpose these work great. I find them comfortable to wear for hours at a time and frequently use them to listen to music and edit video work.I was very surprised to hear the EQ difference between these and the AS10's. Both have more clarity and detail than anything I've used before, including $400+ Bose headphones. The ZS10's have a far brighter EQ than the AS10's (which are warmer and more bottom heavy, but not what I'd call boomy). The ZS10's have a lot of top end clarity and fairly tight/controlled bass. I boost the bass slightly on my SoundBlaster external interface. Switching between these two earphones is chalk and cheese, but after a few minutes on either I'm content.For 5 drivers per side, at this sort of money, this is hard to beat.  "
"31","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Mitchell Winyard","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 31 October 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Ich habe die Moondrop Chu 2 Kopfhörer nun seit einigen Wochen getestet und bin schlichtweg beeindruckt von ihrer Leistung, besonders wenn man den erschwinglichen Preis von nur 18€ berücksichtigt.Der Klang dieser Kopfhörer ist bemerkenswert sauber und klar. Die Höhen sind präzise, die Mitten gut ausbalanciert, und der Bass kommt kräftig und dennoch präzise durch. Das resultierende Hörerlebnis ist für mich persönlich äußerst zufriedenstellend, da die Chu 2 eine beeindruckende Klarheit und Detailtreue bieten.Ein weiterer Pluspunkt für mich ist der herausragende Bass-Response. Die tiefen Töne kommen kraftvoll durch, ohne dabei die anderen Frequenzen zu überlagern. Dies verleiht der Musik eine angenehme Dynamik und Tiefe, besonders bei genrespezifischen Tracks, in denen der Bass eine entscheidende Rolle spielt.Die Möglichkeit, das Kabel abzunehmen, ist ein durchdachtes Feature, das die Lebensdauer der Kopfhörer verlängert und gleichzeitig die Flexibilität erhöht. Das Kabel kann nach Bedarf leicht ersetzt werden, und dies ist definitiv ein Pluspunkt für die Langlebigkeit der Chu 2.Für mich persönlich sind diese Kopfhörer ein absolutes No-Brainer-Angebot. Der Preis von 18€ ist mehr als fair angesichts der gebotenen Klangqualität und der zusätzlichen Funktionen. Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist schlichtweg beeindruckend und macht die Moondrop Chu 2 zu einer klaren Empfehlung für jeden, der auf der Suche nach hochwertigen Kopfhörern zu einem erschwinglichen Preis ist.Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass dies meine subjektive Meinung ist und das Hörerlebnis von Person zu Person variieren kann. Dennoch bin ich persönlich von den Moondrop Chu 2 Kopfhörern überzeugt und kann sie ohne Bedenken weiterempfehlen.    "

I was scared of overspending looking for good quality for sure, but I say this was the best choice to make as I had no clue what I'm getting myself into. Highly recommend. Super neutral sound, extremely versatile for your EQ needs, I don't personally use any lossless files so I can't speak in that matter, but the instrument separation is impressive! Highly recommend.

"38","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Analyn","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 20 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I feel like I just robbed someone. These sound better then earphones costing over $200. I had to come here just to write a review. These sound almost like over ear headphones they have a wider soundstage then any other earphones. The lows are phenomenal and the mids & highs. These are perfection and they get loud. The highs are perfect not harsh or fatiguing at all, but still energetic n nice highs. Super deep nice lows, natural mids. They sound very full and big something you would expect from much bigger drivers like over ear headphones. Plus the build quality alone makes it worth the money, they are all metal and again better then earphones costing $200+. The wire is amazing and I would pay the money for the wire alone, its detachable and you can add in a wire with a mic or a balanced cable. Also comes with a nice high quality carrying case, some sort of soft feeling leather.  "

Cable looping over ears seemed a bit strange at first but it holds them securely and makes them very comfortable to wear for long periods. They have a very balanced sound and you can hear an amazing level of detail and position for instruments and vocals. This is also helped by great sound isolation.
