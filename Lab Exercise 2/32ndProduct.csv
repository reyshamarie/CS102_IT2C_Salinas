"1","Sony In-Ear Lightweight Headphones, White  ","Wayne N.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 13 June 2023","4.4 out of 5 stars","        Really surprised by the quality of these for the price. Bought 2 to test out and will probably buy more. Sound quality is excellent, and the range of flexible inserts helps to get a good fit. The detachable cable is a great idea as the cables and connectors tend to be the first to go. We are using them for in-ear monitors at our church and they have been well received by those who will be using them regularly.Was in contact with their support to get an actual invoice and their service was amazing, very responsive and thorough.Can highly recommend, based on our experience so far.

"5","Sony In-Ear Lightweight Headphones, White  ","M. Dean","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 7 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        The quality of sound you get from these IEMs are suitable for monitoring in a live situation. I would get the comply foam tips to improve its isolation but it definitely punches above its weight in sound quality. I would 100% recommend them.The cable could be redesigned to include an adjuster for the Y connector. It is currently WAY too low on the cable.  "
"6","Sony In-Ear Lightweight Headphones, White  ","Zac","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 8 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","      J'ai achet√© r√©cemment les kz zsn pro et je dois dire que je ne suis pas d√©√ßu.Un packaging √©pur√© comprenant les √©couteurs et le c√¢ble deconnectable pour √©ventuellement le remplacer par un c√¢ble bluetooth ou un autre cable.Une qualit√© sonore vraiment excellente surtout par rapport au prix des √©couteurs. (Ils n'auraient vraiment pas √† rougir devant des √©couteurs plus haut de gamme )Les √©couteurs sont √©galement tes beaux et tr√®s confortable et ce malgr√© le fait que mes oreilles aient une forme particuli√®re qui me pose habituellement quelques soucis avec les √©couteurs. Une fois fix√© √† l'oreille, ils tiennent en place et isole bien du bruit une fois la musique lanc√©e.Pour ce qui est de la durabilit√©,  je devrais attendre de les avoir utilis√© plus pour juger mais le fait que l'on puisse racheter un autre c√¢ble de remplacement permet d'apporter une certaine durabilit√© en replacent juste cette partie √† moindre prix.Je suis pour le moment vraiment content de mon achat.

"7","Sony In-Ear Lightweight Headphones, White  ","Matt Soup","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 10 July 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","        This is my first IEM, so I do not have another IEM to reference and compare this musical apparatus to, but it definitely beats your standard earphone in sound quality and price! The build quality is impressive for the price as well. Lows could have been a bit more prominated, and the highs can be a little too penetrating. But don't allow those minor inconveniences to disway you from purchasing one. A great budget friendly IEM to step you into the world of how music should really sound.  "

"14","Sony In-Ear Lightweight Headphones, White  ","Luca","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 11 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        The buds have a great metal high quality feel to them but yet not heavy on your ears. Can get really loud compared to my over the ear headphones. Great for gaming and jamming out to music. One con thing about them is that they have a real strong plastic smell to them but hopefully over time that will fade out. Overall a very great product!  "

"21","Sony In-Ear Lightweight Headphones, White  ","SAM","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in India on 22 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","      F√ºr das InEar Monitoring unser Gemeindeband gekauft, die Mitten sind wie bereits mehrfach erw√§hnt schon unterversorgt, Sound ist insgesamt ok, f√ºr den Preis aber unschlagbar. Einziges ""Manko"" war, dass es nicht diesen Zug am Nacken gibt womit man beide Kabel hinter den Ohren am Nacken besser festigen kann. Ist oft nur ein kleines durchsichtiges R√∂hrchen, macht aber extrem viel aus was die Tragbarkeit angeht.Eine S√§ngerin mit sehr kleinen Ohren hatte allerdings Probleme mit diesem Modell und ist auf ein anderes Fabrikat gewechselt. Der Rest (8 Personen) kam gut damit klar. Man sollte sie halt keine 2 Stunden durchgehend drin lassen, da wirds dann schon unangenehm. Das trifft aber auf alle IEMs zu, die nicht custom molded sind.    "
"22","Sony In-Ear Lightweight Headphones, White  ","Saurav","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Brazil on 4 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Every other earbud I've tried hurt.  So did these, but when I replace the ear cushions with the correct size (4 or 5 included) they got very comfortable.  Wasn't the case for several other brands that I tried which also came with a variety of covers.  I don't know why, but I'm not complaining.  Sound very good, too.They arrive well-packaged in a neat little white box.  Look well-constructed.  For twenty-one smackeroos, you get great value with these.  I'm considering ordering another pair while I know I still can.  I've been listening via them for four hours - no pain.  Finally, I found a good, comfortable, compact travel 'phone.I'm accustomed to Hifiman HE-400i and Massdrop Sennheiser HD-58X Jubilee.  I use Schiit Modi 2U DAC and Magni 2U Amp.  "
"23","Sony In-Ear Lightweight Headphones, White  ","Artur S.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 18 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        June 3 2020:What I like is that they are awesome monitor headphones. It comes with 4 earbuds to adjust to ear sizes. It cables coming from the drivers do contour behind to your ears. I had to add velcro loop so I can cinch it closer to my head. The only thing that I would say is that I does stick out a bit for not being custom. So for the price & sound quality it‚Äôs awesome. I only have been using it for a few days. What I have researched is that the drivers will adjust after a few usage. I usually use in ear buds & the volume level is about 60% on my laptop. Now with this KZ ZSN volume level is 40% clean & Crisp.  "
"24","Sony In-Ear Lightweight Headphones, White  ","ReaderHal","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Brazil on 25 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        This is my first set of in-ear monitors, so I don't really have a baseline for judging the sound quality. I was previously using regular Bluetooth wireless ear phones, which are OK for practicing to a click or a playback through my phone, but don't have a way to connect to recording equipment.These sound great & with the addition of foam ear tips, block out external sounds to isolate the music coming through the in-ear monitors. I use these all the time when I practice to a playback. I also use them with DAW software to do simple audio editing at times of day when listening through speakers is impractical. I definitely recommend these as a good value, especially at this price.***Edit***I bought a second pair, I like them so much.  "

"28","Sony In-Ear Lightweight Headphones, White  ","Carlos F.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 December 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Unbelievable! These were recommended by a friend who has a high expectation of all audio equipment. Let me say that the level of audio quality is that of a earbud that cost several hundred dollars. I plugged them into my Xbox one controller and was blown away. I was able to hear sound in game that I didn't know existed. They have high highs and low lows. I guarantee you will be satisfied  "
"29","Sony In-Ear Lightweight Headphones, White  ","wise","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 4 June 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Die Tonqualit√§t dieser Kopfh√∂rer ist Gut. Sie √ºbersteigt keineswegs die von High Tier Audiophilen Kopfh√∂rern aber f√ºr den Preis m√ºssen Sie das auch definitiv nicht. Der Sound ist eher Bass lastig und etwas enger aber unterwegs macht genau das Spa√ü. Was die Bauqualit√§t angeht, h√§tte ich gerne einen MMCX Connector gesehen, aber selbst der 2Pin Anschluss ist kein Negativer Punkt im Gegenteil ich w√ºrde mir absteckbare Kabel bei mehr Kopfh√∂rern w√ºnschen und Generell f√ºhlen sich die Kopfh√∂rer sehr gut Verarbeitet an. Ich kann die sie auf jeden Fall empfehlen.    "
"30","Sony In-Ear Lightweight Headphones, White  ","Stolto","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2020","4.4 out of 5 stars","        I was blown away when I listened to these combined with a higher quality DAC then what your phone comes with.Would absolutely suggest that you try these out.The only negative thing I have to say about these are that the installed tips are of bad quality and the extra are of the wrong size so they do not fit the buds. :\But that does not bug me that much, as you can pick them up for next to nothing.

Ich habe zwar den Vergleich zu den Modellen von shure, sennheiser etc nicht, aber den brauche ich auch gar nicht. Eigentlich als Notl√∂sung gekauft, habe ich aufgeh√∂rt, nach Alternativen zu suchen. Von den H√∂hen bis zu den B√§ssen passen diese Teile genau zu meinen Ohren und tragen lassen sie sich auch noch komfortabel. Gl√ºck gehabt ;)    "

Also love that you can replace the cable and even add Bluetooth functionality.  "

Very flat frequency response, plenty of low end clarity, super comfortable. I highly recommend getting some memory foam tips (I purchased the ZNARI sample pack for around $5 and they work fantastically). My only complaint is that the L shaped connector doesn't fit in my phone case so I needed an extension but thankfully I already had one.  "
