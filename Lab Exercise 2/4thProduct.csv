Check the silicone fittings.No-tangle cable is a plus and hassle free.  "

They last long, they Didn't get a short in the wire (I got them tangled a lot), never broke until this year when they stop connecting to my phone. MY FAVORITE DURABLE HEADPHONES. I bought some that said they were compatible with my phone(Being cheap) And they were HORRIBLE!  These are real deal they have duplicate companies saying they sell these, but it doesn't have the C connector and not good quality so beware.  "

"11","Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, Bluetooth Noise Cancelling Earbuds with Spatial Audio and World-Class Noise Cancellation, Black  ","A Golic","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 19 June 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Was looking for a comfortable pair for earphones to listen to music with a higher quality without the need to wear massive headphones. Never knew about IEM's did about ten mins of research and was convinced that these ZS10 PRO is what I needed, I was not disappointed.It takes a bit of fiddling to get the ear plug that works for you, but when you do its heaven. A crisp sound with deep bass (I listen to a lot of edm, rock, metal, screamo and phonk plus the occasional 80's classics) and these produce sounds I've never heard before within songs. 10/10 if you're looking at getting a pair of comfortable earphones what are crazy obvious, you're wearing some which produce great sound, go no further.

"14","Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, Bluetooth Noise Cancelling Earbuds with Spatial Audio and World-Class Noise Cancellation, Black  ","Kyaw Nanda","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 20 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I followed the instructions and started with the smallest silicon earpieces. Ended up with the second smallest, which are comfortable, and still seal the ear canals.I couldn't see a L or an R anywhere but figured the cable with the button is the right channel.Worked out which way around the pods go and plugged them in.I am listening to them through a XDUOO XD05 Bal DAC/Headphone Amp.Hard to say they sound as good as my $400 Sony WH1000 Noise-cancelling headphones, but they sound great, and I have no desire to change. They are truly a comfortable fit once you get the silicon earpiece sizes sorted. Also a lot less cumbersome to wear and not as expensive to lose as the WH1000 Headphones; and they fit in my pocket, although I'd probably use a pouch first.3.5mm plug didn't want to plug into the phone and stay but did snap into the 3.5mm to 6.5mm adaptor that plugs into the DAC.Well worth the coin.

"15","Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, Bluetooth Noise Cancelling Earbuds with Spatial Audio and World-Class Noise Cancellation, Black  ","Cytokyn","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 4 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        They work, They're loud, They're clear (very Clear) and I think that they will go pound for pound with many of the other models out there with a much higher price point. If you are looking to buy these for everyday use and not professional use. Then you have found a decent set of plugs.... Now, you're gonna have other users tell you they are muddy, tinny, lack mid and even have overpowering mids.. let's face it, you're probably not even going to notice as a standard user listening to Spotify... If you're a professional and need them for specific work or whatever, then this isn't the review for you. All i can say as what i call a standard user/music lover they get the job done and done very well... Fit better then that air pods pro from a fit side. Do have some weight from the styling of the metal and the cable will question your ability to set them up.. The over ear cable also secured them well after i had to swap the way i put them together. Passive sound isolation is as others would be. Ear tips a comfortable. Cable length is acceptable. would buy again if i had to purchase another pair.  "

I’m also biased because this is my first ever in-ear monitor, but if you are in the same place as me, it is a great choice. It can be a bit bulky when you put it in your ear, if you get to compare with other brands. But who cares? It is comfortable in my ears. :D  "

And it’s super comfortable and at times you forget you’re wearing it.My only complaint is that the cable is a bit too short for my needs. These are my first ever in ear monitor earphones so not sure if that’s a standard length hence I didn’t take off any stars for it.Otherwise I’m happy with it. Sound quality was great, already helped me fix some of my vocal and guitar mixing for my helix live performance presets.I do recommend the purchase.  "

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing and the bass punches way above it’s weight. I ended up buying another set as back up…totally in love with these and no one will change my mind 😀  "

"31","Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, Bluetooth Noise Cancelling Earbuds with Spatial Audio and World-Class Noise Cancellation, Black  ","castorina giuseppe","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 27 December 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars","        Over the years I have used different headphones/earphones. Some have been wireless (Bluetooth), some wired, some over-ear, some in-ear. My ears are not very good. I use 2 hearing aids. While my wife watches TV, in the same room, to keep her company, I watch YouTube, BBC iPlayer, or Amazon Prime videos on a mobile phone, tablet or laptop. It is important that I mute the external speakers so as not to spoil my wife's listening, hence the need for headphones/earphones.Using these phones, I needed subtitles, because the sound was ""blurred"", causing me to miss important speech. Because of the lack of speech clarity, I was reluctant to pay for expensive phones, for fear of wasting the high cost. Then I purchased a Samsung Galaxy mobile phone about a year ago. With it was a free Samsung AKG in-earphones, USBc plug type. They were left untouched for many months, partly because they were not Bluetooth, and partly because I had no confidence that yet another set would be any different. A few months ago, I discovered them in the mobile phone box, and decided to try them before binning them.Well!! The Samsung AKG earphones were so clear that I hardly need subtitles any more. It's like I am back to my young ears again. I was so pleased that I purchased a second set to use with the Tablet and Laptop.I discovered that using one of those little USBc to USBa adapters works just as well in the Laptop, if the USBc port is used for something else. All my previous ear/headphones have been made redundant.  "

I ordered these as a gift, but the person I ordered them for could not use them with their Galaxy S7 phone.  I opted to send them back but the seller negotiated with me to keep them and he/she also sent me another sets for the Galaxy S7 at no cost.  I highly recommend these earphones for the quality sound, comfort of use and value for money.  These seller is thorough!  "

Well-balanced frequency response, across bass, mid and treble frequencies. Microphone works well with phone calls, and the volume buttons work too. Comes with eartips in three sizes - the ear sealing is adequate. The wires do get tangled quite easily, but at least you don't need to charge these!  "
