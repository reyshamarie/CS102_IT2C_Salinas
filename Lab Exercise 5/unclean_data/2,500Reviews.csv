"2","Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Graphite  ","Kenma","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 17 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I had been using a cheap pair of buds that I bought from Amazon and thought they were excellent. For my birthday I decided to updates to the Galaxy Buds to pair with my new Galaxy Phone. I was amazed at how much better they were than my old ones and especially love that the battery lasts a long time and also that the app provides me with so many options for customisation. Excrement happy.  "

You'd likely require in excess of several thousands of dollars for custom headphones if you're looking for studio quality sound.  "

Incredible value for money especially on sale for $209. The only thing I would point out is that they can struggle to stay in your ear if you have weirdly shaped ear canals like me. I solved this by putting O rings on nozzle below the silicone tips.  "

Ok,  sound quality 9/10, ANC 8/10, ambient mode 10/10, build quality 10/10The ambient mode is impressive; I can hear better with the buds in, especially if you turn on the boost mode.All in all, they're pretty good.

"51","Linsoul KZ ZS10 Pro, 4BA+1DD 5 Driver in Ear Monitor, HiFi Wired Earbuds, Gaming Earbuds, Hybrid IEM Earphones with Stainless Steel Faceplate, 2 Pin Detachable Cable (Without Mic, Black)  ","Jimmy Mahjong","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 23 February 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars","        Very well tuned and an overall improvement from the first generation chu, to my ears.Moondrop has bumped the bass and smoothed out the treble, resolving the slightly metallic timbre of the first gen chu. I never had an issue with the amount of bass on the originals, but a lot of people did, this should fix that.These are now what I would describe as a slightly v-shaped sound signature, but it certainly still manages to remain articulate and engaging, very fun!Vocals are still a strong point, albeit maybe very slightly recessed compared to other Moondrop products (non issue), bass and slam is well controlled and treble has nice sparkle.No more spring tips included, just the standard Moondrop tips, and the nozzle now screws off allowing you to easily replace the filter. Moondrop filters are known to clog up with condensation/moisture resulting in channel imbalance, but I have yet to have this issue with any of my Moondrop iems, maybe I’m just lucky, maybe it’s worse in humid climates.If you do encounter this issue I believe either sucking on it lightly (seriously) or replacing/cleaning the filter will work to fix it for the time being.They also fit great in the ear. Like the chu 1, they’re small and don’t interfere, but don’t sit as flat as something like the Aria would.Remember, these are less than $30, have removable cables (a nice one too, imo), sound good. They make a great gift, too.  "

"58","Linsoul KZ ZS10 Pro, 4BA+1DD 5 Driver in Ear Monitor, HiFi Wired Earbuds, Gaming Earbuds, Hybrid IEM Earphones with Stainless Steel Faceplate, 2 Pin Detachable Cable (Without Mic, Black)  ","Audio Reviews Downunder","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 18 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        To get my background of out the way, I am in no way an expert in sound and this review is purely from a guy that dabbles a bit in different headsets and earphones and enjoys a good pair of cans. I am currently rocking philips fidelio x3, not the best but also far from a cheap headphone, as well as samsung earbuds pro and i've tested different headsets throughout my years, even really expensive ones at the airport :D. I enjoy a fun sound signature and also love me some ear vibrating bass.  This is my first time trying an IEM.With that out of the way, oh my god these IEMs are fantastic. This is as I said my first pair that I got and just wanted to have some earphones that sound fine when i'm at my laptop or travel somewhere. Their sound is fantastic, good soundstage where you can seperate all the different elements, super clear and very well tuned WHILE having a ear vibrating bass. The bass is awesome and right up my alley for the music I listen to. It manages to feed my above average hunger for bass while at the same time keeping the mids and the highs clean, separatable and just as good as the bass. The bass also has great separation and doesn't sound muddy and doesn't overwhelming the other frequencies at all. To keep it short, if you told me that these cost 100-200 euro, I would not be mad at all and probably still consider buying them. The fact that these are only 20 ish euro, makes it an insta buy in my opinion. As this is my first IEM, I can't really speak for the rest of the market, im sure there are better IEMs out there, but 20 euros is seriously a laughable price for this good sound quality.If you are on the fence on buying these, and also enjoy bass while wanting the rest to be clear and crisp and separatable, then I would strongly recommend buying these, you won't be disappointed. These really blew it out the water.  "

Para los que tienen dudas acerca del bajo, buen impacto sin distorsiones y sin opacar al resto de frecuencias, una verdadera chulada. Si me los pongo a ciegas y me dicen que son IEM’s de 200€, tengo serias dudas.Edit de 5 días después: todavía más convencido de lo que he puesto arriba; los uso para escuchar música y jugar a Valorant, y no defraudan en absolutamente nada, muy buena inmersión, los pasos se nota perfectamente de dónde vienen, y escucho aspectos del juego que con unos logitech de 200€ no escuchaba antes, durante más de 3 años jugando al juego. Sin duda alguna no voy a volver a comprarme unos cascos en mi vida, mientras existan cosas de18€ como ésta. Muy cómodos además, los llevas durante horas y perfecto.    "
"60","Linsoul KZ ZS10 Pro, 4BA+1DD 5 Driver in Ear Monitor, HiFi Wired Earbuds, Gaming Earbuds, Hybrid IEM Earphones with Stainless Steel Faceplate, 2 Pin Detachable Cable (Without Mic, Black)  ","bellcamp","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Sweden on 25 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Note: this review is all done with comply eartips, but the silicone tips included sound very similar if you can get a good seal.These things are amazing.. I picked them up after seeing Crinacle’s review of the original Moondrop Chu, and comparing other reviews between the Chu & Chu 2. The original Chu don’t have a removable cable, they have less bass, and a much more flat tuning which some may not enjoy as much for everyday listening. I listen to drum & bass more than anything else, so the decision was a no-brainer.Fitment: these are relatively small IEMs, so they sit almost flush with the outside of your ear, depending how deep you can insert the nozzle. That’s where one of the biggest complaints I have about these comes in. The nozzle width is massive, easily the largest of any IEMs I own. 500 series comply tips fit, but even the included silicone tips fit really tight around the nozzle. This means some people with smaller ear canals might not be able to fit these in as far as other IEMs. Otherwise they’re plenty comfortable, even when lying on your side to sleep.Build quality: they’re cheap, but don’t feel cheap like many chi-fi units. They’re apparently made of some metal alloy, but are still crazy light. They’re far from the flimsy garbage you’ll get with many KZ or other budget chi-fi brand models. Time will tell how they hold up, but I doubt they’ll see any damage beyond a few paint scratches here and there from tossing them into my bag.Sound: this is where things get crazy.. The original Chu scored so high on tuning that it was embarrassing a ton of $100 IEMs.. The technical capabilities fell short in comparison, but even then it’s far above what most would expect from something in this price bracket. Unfortunately I don’t have an original Chu to compare to, but from all I’ve seen these are more of a V shaped tuning. The bass is PHENOMENAL on these, which really surprised me. I’ve never heard sub bass this well done in IEMs before, period. I’ve listened to a wide selection over the years, from classic models like the Shure se215 (basically garbage now a days, frankly these outperform those in almost every way) to full customs worth over $1000. Nothing has hit me with this visceral sub bass. The best part is that it doesn’t muddy up the rest of the sound. The mid bass is still really punchy, and the mids stay well separated. The mids and highs are good, but not as crisp as I’d like. Comparing them to my Fiio F9 pro (dual BA for mids and highs, dedicated DD for lows) the brightness of the F9s really stood out, but they were also about 10x the price at launch. At the end of the day I have no complaints with the sound on these when considering just how ridiculously cheap they are, and have actually been using them above the rest of my IEMs just for that wicked sub bass.Accessories: they come with 3 pairs of silicone tips, which actually seem smaller than most (almost like they’re XS, S, and M). The included cable is fine, it doesn’t seem to tangle easily, and feels way more solid than the original cables that came with my F9 pros. They also include a little pouch that is serviceable, but a cheap zippered bag will do you much better for regular use.Overall: just buy them, you can’t go wrong for the price, and there’s really nothing else like this on the market right now. Unless you want to spend over $100, there’s no reason to look at anything else (aside from maybe the original Chu, but the lack of removable cable is a dealbreaker for me)  "

They sound great and have an incredible metal build while being light  and comfortable. Buy these. WtfThe Build:How are these $20… This is the most premium headphone I've ever opened and it was $20. They're insane. They are metal. They feel substantial in your hand, but light when you put them in they are so small and the fit is incredible, unsurprising for IEMs anyways, but I have some CCZ coffee beans that fit great but are bigger so don't enter as deeply, so these definitely take the cake.They have a leather pouch which is Primo, and not what I was expecting (I didn't see any pics beforehand).The eartips are pretty standard (no foam) and do a good job blocking out the outside world, it’s no active noise canceling and I’ve used better passive, but again they’re 20 bucks.The cable is a bit thinner than other IEM’s I have, and they don't have controls or a microphone. There is a slightly more expensive version with a thicker cable and controls and a mic, although its’ USB-C? Honestly I like the cable, it's light and more out of the way, and if nothing else I’ll just use a different cable from another set of IEM’s.The Sound:They sound excellent. I do think that the mids and highs are a little darker than I'm used to, but it's nothing that I couldn't fix myself with an EQ. They’ve very detailed, I'm running them with the BTR 5 and with Wavelet on and they sound pretty crisp. They're not the most clean I've ever heard, but definitely up there, and ESPECIALLY for $20. I do wish they were treblier, but I’m being picky at that point.I listened to a FLAC of AM by the Arctic Monkeys and they sound real good.I’m not sure what else to say about the sound, it’s dark and bassy, but it's nice and smooth; it’s unlike the bass outta some headphones I’ve tried.They do get loud. I've been listening to them at 60 percent without issue, they do get too loud at about 85 percent, if you’re into that sort of thing.The Music:FLAC - AM by Arctic MonkeysFLAC - Discovery by Daft PunkFLAC - IGOR by Tyler, The CreatorSpotify - I Need to Start a Garden by Haley HeyndrickxSpotify - Locket by CrumbSpotify - Various songs by MitskiThe Conclusion:I'm definitely going to be daily driving them at least for a bit, and again just an incredible package for 20 bucks (I'm excited for the leather pouch). I’m thinking these will be a great gift for friends.The Waifu:Excellent, my wife likes pandas lol  "

The treble is not harsh or fatiguing and the bass is just right. I use them daily now, especially before I go to sleep. At this moment I only use the Chu 2 and my HiFiMan re800. All my other IEM’s are currently not in use. In my opinion these earphones sound like they cost between 80,- and 120,- euro or even more, sounding better then my KZ PR1 Pro, Hidisz MS2 and Hidisz MS3 that cost about 5 times more than the Chu 2.I strongly recommend the Chu 2, no need to buy more expensive earphones. In my opinion the best IEM of 2023.  "

Die Meinungen über kpop gehen auseinander, aber jeder sollte der Meinung sein das nichts auf so einem Headset gut klingt.Ich habe also, als ein guter Freund, etwas recherchiert und bin auf die Chu II gestoßen. Der Reviewer Crinacle hatte ihnen drei von drei Sternen für Preis Leistung und ein B+ für Klang gegeben. Klang also ganz gut. (kleiner Scherz)Auch die Tatsache das die Gehäuse aus Metall und die Kabel und soweit ich verstanden habe auch die Filter abnehmbar sind, fand ich in Hinblick auf Langlebigkeit sehr gut. Nicht viel ist nerviger als ein Kopfhörer mit kaputtem Kabel. Die hier verwendeten Kabel scheinen einem Standard zu folgen und sind dementsprechend einfach zu ersetzen.Der Versand kann aus China und ich muss zugeben, dass ich ein paar mal schon geglaubt hatte, dass das Paket verloren gegangen war, als das tracking den dritten Tag in Folge sagte das Paket wäre immer noch beim einladen in ein Flugzeug in China. Aber es kam rechtzeitig an.Wegen dem geringen Preis hatte ich mich dagegen entschieden es zum Weihnachtsgeschenk zu machen, sondern war zum Nikolaus umgesprungen. Im Nachhinein hätte ich auch ohne Probleme beim Weihnachtsgeschenk bleiben können.Angefangen bei der Packung wirkt alles nach einem Premium Produkt. Die kleine fast schon für Schmuck geeignete Schachtel ist scharf und sauber mit dem kleinen Panda waifu bedruckt. Die Rückseite zeigt stolz die Frequenzkurve die mir als Laien wenig sagt aber durchaus geschätzt wird.Die IEMs selbst sind in Schaum eingebettet und wirken durch ihr Gewicht und metallisch kühle Oberfläche durchaus wertig.Als Neuling zu IEMs die nicht gratis zu einem Handy dazu kommen kann der Anschluß des Kabels etwas verwirrend sein, aber die beiliegende Anleitung erklärt dies ausreichend gut. Erstaunlicherweise ohne die üblichen Grammatik und Wort Fehlern üblich für günstige Elektronik aus China.Es hätte mir also ohne Probleme jeder abgenommen wenn ich an Heiligabend gesagt hätte das dies gerade so mit drei Coupons in unser 50€ Geschenk Budget rein gepasst hätte.Aber jetzt mal das wichtigste, der Klang.Sie klingen besser als sie jedes Recht haben.Die hohen Töne kann ich noch so gerade verstehen, aber wie diese kleinen Dinger es hin bekommen ernsthaften Bass zu erzeugen verstehe ich nicht.Ich habe kein Ohr dafür zu sagen ob das was man da hört Hifi oder wie vom Künstler beabsichtigt ist, aber ich kann sagen das es gut klingt.Ich bin mir sicher, dass die meisten Leute mit der hier gebotenen Klangqualität mehr als zufrieden sind.Nur für Sport im Freien sollte man sie nicht verwenden. Wenn die Teile im Ohr sind schirmen die alle anderen Geräusche ab. Steht auch tatsächlich auf dem Beipackzettel.    "
"68","Linsoul KZ ZS10 Pro, 4BA+1DD 5 Driver in Ear Monitor, HiFi Wired Earbuds, Gaming Earbuds, Hybrid IEM Earphones with Stainless Steel Faceplate, 2 Pin Detachable Cable (Without Mic, Black)  ","gilberto dominguez","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Poland on 8 January 2024","2.0 out of 5 stars","        I'm surprised to see some rather mediocre reviews re these Chu 2s as I found them to be clear, open (for IEMs), have good soundstage (for IEMs), have no overwhelming bass or treble, no treble splash, no noticeable straining at higher volumes, no over or under presentation of male or female singers & a good balance between instruments & voices. They are also easy to drive.The earphones are very well made using zinc alloy (completely I think) & are a steal at £19.  They are very compact, lightweight & not at all bulky - diminutive. However, their sound is not hampered by their physical size.  The unique aluminium/magnesium diaphragm used seems to have made a big positive difference to the overall sound.I didn't use the cable that came with the phones - instead I used a reference one & this proved that the Chu's are worthy of upgrading the cable if you want to improve sound quality.  These probably aren't for those who consider themselves baseheads but will suit those looking for good sound accuracy & a balanced sound.  In my opinion, they're worthy successors to the original Chu's.  Recommended  "
"69","Linsoul KZ ZS10 Pro, 4BA+1DD 5 Driver in Ear Monitor, HiFi Wired Earbuds, Gaming Earbuds, Hybrid IEM Earphones with Stainless Steel Faceplate, 2 Pin Detachable Cable (Without Mic, Black)  ","gilberto dominguez","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the Netherlands on 25 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I will be comparing these Chu 2s ($19) to the original Chu's ($20-22), the Tanchjim Zero's ($15-16), and my Gen 2 Airpod Pros ($200-250). I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I do enjoy hunting for great affordable sound under $40 and comparing the results. I tend to prefer headphones that have a more flat and balanced sound, in short nothing that has too much added bass.THE SOUND QUALITY:The highs and mids sound on par with the original Chu's and the Zeros (which I found traded blows in sound quality, I couldn't crown one better than the other). Vocals and instruments in that range are very clean, clear, and pleasant. Where these differentiate from its predecessors are in the bass and lows. The sound feels more impactful while not being overbearing or muddy. It has a little more flavor than a balanced flat sound signature but it doesn't overdo the lows. The original Chu's and the Zeros can feel a little lifeless on bass-heavy/prominent songs so I would tend to switch to my AirPods when listening to those types of songs. With the Chu 2s I don't feel that need. The bass feels on par with the Airpod Pros 2 (which is fairly clean) while the highs and mids sound better and clearer in my opinion. The bass sound profile isn't exactly the same as the AirPods, but the difference is too small for me to be able to put into words how they differ.Overall, if I want to use a pair of headphones with the best sound quality capable of listening to any genre of music then I would use the Chu 2s over my daily driver Airpods Pro Gen 2. Otherwise, if I specifically want to decrease the emphasis on the bass for a particular song then I may switch to the Zero's or original Chu's.THE TIPSPersonally, I prefer the white Spring Tips ($13 after market for a single size) that come with the Original Chu's. They are slightly more comfortable and way easier to remove than the ones included with the Chu 2s. The Chu 2s tips are nothing special. They are not bad, but they aren't note worthy either. The Zero's come with similar tips to the Chu 2s, but with way more options in terms of shape and size. You are pretty much guaranteed to find a size that fits well if you get the Zero's. The Zeros also have various size diameters in the hole which I assume is to achieve different sound signatures, but my ears are not sensitive enough to pick up on any changes. I included an image that showcases all the tips included with each pair.THE CABLE AND FITThe Chu 2s win this hands down in my opinion. First off its removable so its easy to replace. It also has a firm soft plastic around where it grips on your ear which makes it obvious on how these are meant to be worn and are quite comfortable. This cable helps negate the downgrade in the tips. It comes with a right angle audio jack. If that doesn't work for your device then you can always swap the cable.The original Chu's had a comfortable fit without the included rubber guide, but selecting the microphone option definitely degraded the comfort for me. The rubber used on the cable could be a little unrully at times. This also has a right angle audio jack.The Zeros are the lightest being all plastic and thus take a little longer to put on properly in a way that comfortable (they also lack an L+R indicator which doesn't help the process). This is the only option with a thin straight audio jack so it will work will if you need to plug it into a recessed port. This product definitely feels the cheapest (which it is by 20-25%) out of the three, but I wouldn't call it bad.REPAIRABLITYBoth the Chu and the Chu 2 have filters that can be replaced. You can tell they need to be replaced if the audio becomes quieter in one ear. A replacement set of filters will run you around $5. The Chu 2s also have the replaceable cable which makes them the clear winner in this category.TLDRAll the IEMs listed are excellent in this price bracket and hit well above their weight. The Chu 2s are the most versatile and sound great with any genre of music and are also the most repairable.  "

Das resultierende Hörerlebnis ist für mich persönlich äußerst zufriedenstellend, da die Chu 2 eine beeindruckende Klarheit und Detailtreue bieten.Ein weiterer Pluspunkt für mich ist der herausragende Bass-Response. Die tiefen Töne kommen kraftvoll durch, ohne dabei die anderen Frequenzen zu überlagern. Dies verleiht der Musik eine angenehme Dynamik und Tiefe, besonders bei genrespezifischen Tracks, in denen der Bass eine entscheidende Rolle spielt.Die Möglichkeit, das Kabel abzunehmen, ist ein durchdachtes Feature, das die Lebensdauer der Kopfhörer verlängert und gleichzeitig die Flexibilität erhöht. Das Kabel kann nach Bedarf leicht ersetzt werden, und dies ist definitiv ein Pluspunkt für die Langlebigkeit der Chu 2.Für mich persönlich sind diese Kopfhörer ein absolutes No-Brainer-Angebot. Der Preis von 18€ ist mehr als fair angesichts der gebotenen Klangqualität und der zusätzlichen Funktionen. Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist schlichtweg beeindruckend und macht die Moondrop Chu 2 zu einer klaren Empfehlung für jeden, der auf der Suche nach hochwertigen Kopfhörern zu einem erschwinglichen Preis ist.Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass dies meine subjektive Meinung ist und das Hörerlebnis von Person zu Person variieren kann.

They deliver, and they deliver well! Earbuds like ear plugs, meaning you don't need any fancy noise cancelling, as there's just no noise at all. Cable is nice but not braided like the ZSN Pro X model I have, which was a bit disappointing as it has a bit of memory and likes to coil up a bit, but with wear, it straightens out fine.Keep it up KZ!

They are truly a comfortable fit once you get the silicon earpiece sizes sorted. Also a lot less cumbersome to wear and not as expensive to lose as the WH1000 Headphones; and they fit in my pocket, although I'd probably use a pouch first.3.5mm plug didn't want to plug into the phone and stay but did snap into the 3.5mm to 6.5mm adaptor that plugs into the DAC.Well worth the coin.

"115","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Daniel Gorgievski","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 4 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        They work, They're loud, They're clear (very Clear) and I think that they will go pound for pound with many of the other models out there with a much higher price point. If you are looking to buy these for everyday use and not professional use. Then you have found a decent set of plugs.... Now, you're gonna have other users tell you they are muddy, tinny, lack mid and even have overpowering mids.. let's face it, you're probably not even going to notice as a standard user listening to Spotify... If you're a professional and need them for specific work or whatever, then this isn't the review for you. All i can say as what i call a standard user/music lover they get the job done and done very well... Fit better then that air pods pro from a fit side. Do have some weight from the styling of the metal and the cable will question your ability to set them up.. The over ear cable also secured them well after i had to swap the way i put them together. Passive sound isolation is as others would be. Ear tips a comfortable. Cable length is acceptable. would buy again if i had to purchase another pair.  "

I found myself skipping through tracks trying to find a genre that they would stumble on, but they're surprisingly well balanced.

"130","JBL Wave Flex True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Black  ","Christian Ramsden","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 2 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        My first KZ product was a pair of AS10's, which I loved and still have 2 years later. I wanted a new set of earphones (with a mic) to use for conference calls (Skype / Zoom etc) at my workstation. For that purpose these work great. I find them comfortable to wear for hours at a time and frequently use them to listen to music and edit video work.I was very surprised to hear the EQ difference between these and the AS10's. Both have more clarity and detail than anything I've used before, including $400+ Bose headphones. The ZS10's have a far brighter EQ than the AS10's (which are warmer and more bottom heavy, but not what I'd call boomy). The ZS10's have a lot of top end clarity and fairly tight/controlled bass. I boost the bass slightly on my SoundBlaster external interface. Switching between these two earphones is chalk and cheese, but after a few minutes on either I'm content.For 5 drivers per side, at this sort of money, this is hard to beat.  "

Die Höhen sind präzise, die Mitten gut ausbalanciert, und der Bass kommt kräftig und dennoch präzise durch. Das resultierende Hörerlebnis ist für mich persönlich äußerst zufriedenstellend, da die Chu 2 eine beeindruckende Klarheit und Detailtreue bieten.Ein weiterer Pluspunkt für mich ist der herausragende Bass-Response. Die tiefen Töne kommen kraftvoll durch, ohne dabei die anderen Frequenzen zu überlagern. Dies verleiht der Musik eine angenehme Dynamik und Tiefe, besonders bei genrespezifischen Tracks, in denen der Bass eine entscheidende Rolle spielt.Die Möglichkeit, das Kabel abzunehmen, ist ein durchdachtes Feature, das die Lebensdauer der Kopfhörer verlängert und gleichzeitig die Flexibilität erhöht. Das Kabel kann nach Bedarf leicht ersetzt werden, und dies ist definitiv ein Pluspunkt für die Langlebigkeit der Chu 2.Für mich persönlich sind diese Kopfhörer ein absolutes No-Brainer-Angebot. Der Preis von 18€ ist mehr als fair angesichts der gebotenen Klangqualität und der zusätzlichen Funktionen. Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist schlichtweg beeindruckend und macht die Moondrop Chu 2 zu einer klaren Empfehlung für jeden, der auf der Suche nach hochwertigen Kopfhörern zu einem erschwinglichen Preis ist.Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass dies meine subjektive Meinung ist und das Hörerlebnis von Person zu Person variieren kann. Dennoch bin ich persönlich von den Moondrop Chu 2 Kopfhörern überzeugt und kann sie ohne Bedenken weiterempfehlen.    "

Super deep nice lows, natural mids. They sound very full and big something you would expect from much bigger drivers like over ear headphones. Plus the build quality alone makes it worth the money, they are all metal and again better then earphones costing $200+.

A crisp sound with deep bass (I listen to a lot of edm, rock, metal, screamo and phonk plus the occasional 80's classics) and these produce sounds I've never heard before within songs. 10/10 if you're looking at getting a pair of comfortable earphones what are crazy obvious, you're wearing some which produce great sound, go no further.

Ended up with the second smallest, which are comfortable, and still seal the ear canals.I couldn't see a L or an R anywhere but figured the cable with the button is the right channel.Worked out which way around the pods go and plugged them in.I am listening to them through a XDUOO XD05 Bal DAC/Headphone Amp.Hard to say they sound as good as my $400 Sony WH1000 Noise-cancelling headphones, but they sound great, and I have no desire to change. They are truly a comfortable fit once you get the silicon earpiece sizes sorted. Also a lot less cumbersome to wear and not as expensive to lose as the WH1000 Headphones; and they fit in my pocket, although I'd probably use a pouch first.3.5mm plug didn't want to plug into the phone and stay but did snap into the 3.5mm to 6.5mm adaptor that plugs into the DAC.Well worth the coin.

If you are looking to buy these for everyday use and not professional use. Then you have found a decent set of plugs.... Now, you're gonna have other users tell you they are muddy, tinny, lack mid and even have overpowering mids.. let's face it, you're probably not even going to notice as a standard user listening to Spotify... If you're a professional and need them for specific work or whatever, then this isn't the review for you. All i can say as what i call a standard user/music lover they get the job done and done very well... Fit better then that air pods pro from a fit side. Do have some weight from the styling of the metal and the cable will question your ability to set them up.. The over ear cable also secured them well after i had to swap the way i put them together. Passive sound isolation is as others would be. Ear tips a comfortable. Cable length is acceptable. would buy again if i had to purchase another pair.  "

Some have been wireless (Bluetooth), some wired, some over-ear, some in-ear. My ears are not very good. I use 2 hearing aids. While my wife watches TV, in the same room, to keep her company, I watch YouTube, BBC iPlayer, or Amazon Prime videos on a mobile phone, tablet or laptop. It is important that I mute the external speakers so as not to spoil my wife's listening, hence the need for headphones/earphones.Using these phones, I needed subtitles, because the sound was ""blurred"", causing me to miss important speech. Because of the lack of speech clarity, I was reluctant to pay for expensive phones, for fear of wasting the high cost. Then I purchased a Samsung Galaxy mobile phone about a year ago. With it was a free Samsung AKG in-earphones, USBc plug type. They were left untouched for many months, partly because they were not Bluetooth, and partly because I had no confidence that yet another set would be any different. A few months ago, I discovered them in the mobile phone box, and decided to try them before binning them.Well!! The Samsung AKG earphones were so clear that I hardly need subtitles any more. It's like I am back to my young ears again. I was so pleased that I purchased a second set to use with the Tablet and Laptop.I discovered that using one of those little USBc to USBa adapters works just as well in the Laptop, if the USBc port is used for something else. All my previous ear/headphones have been made redundant.  "

"202","Soundcore by Anker, Soundcore Sport X10 True Wireless Bluetooth 5.2 Workout Headphones, Rotatable Ear Hooks, Deep Bass, IPX7 Waterproof, Sweatproof, 32H Play, Fast Charge, Sport Earbuds, Gym, Running  ","Andrea","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Italy on 14 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Dopo circa un mese di utilizzo devo dire che sono molto soddisfatto dell'acquisto.Gli auricolari hanno una buona resa acustica (forse un volume non altissimo ma comunque più che sufficiente nella maggior parte delle situazioni), sono leggeri e devo dire per niente fastidiosi da indossare, anche dopo lungo tempo. Sono abbastanza stabili e riesco a fare qualunque attività senza che ci sia il rischio che si sfilino, compreso lo sport. Forse per sport estremi, molto movimentati, potrebbero non essere l'ideale, ma in ogni caso suppongo che la cosa possa variare da persona a persona per via della forma delle orecchie diversa per ognuno di noi.La durata della batteria è eccellente e considerando che dopo ogni uso, riponendoli nella custodia, gli auricolari si caricano, praticamente ogni volta che li usiamo li troviamo al 100% di batteria. Dovrebbero durare circa 8 ore in uso continuato ma non sono mai riuscito a scaricarli completamente per cui non posso dare conferma. In ogni caso 10 minuti di carica garatisce 2 ore di batteria, per cui riuscire a scaricarli del tutto e non poterli utilizzare è una operazione quasi impossibile. Chiaramente la custodia deve essere sempre a portata di mano, altrimenti la ricarica è impossibile. Sulla custodia c'è un led che si accende per qualche secondo ogni volta che gli aricolari vengono tolti o messi in carica e indica la quantità di batteria residua della custodia stessa: verde, arancione o rossa  a seconda della quantità di batteria residua. Con la custodia è possibile avere altre 3 cariche complete, quindi sommando alle 8 ore degli auricolari diventano 30 ore di autonomia (dichiarate).Il suono è molto buono, i bassi si sentono bene ed è comunque possibile modificare l'equalizzazione attraverso un app.La connessione al dispositivo è praticamente immediata: il tempo di togliere gli auricolari dalla custodia e di indossarli e sono già connessi e funzionanti. Possono essere usati anche separatamente.E' possibile gestire sia il play/pausa/avanti/indietro durante l'ascolto della musica che il volume, oltre all'immancabile assitente vocale che personalmente non uso quindi non ho provato.I comandi sono touch e questo è un bene e un male allo stesso tempo. Un bene perchè gli auricolari sono più ""puliti"" esteticamente e perchè i comandi touch danno comunque l'idea di qualcosa di un livello più alto rispetto a roba più economica. Il lato negativo è che non è poi così semplice da utilizzare un comando touch da effettuare su qualcosa che non si vede (lo si fa ovviamente alla cieca durante l'uso) per cui bisogna fare pratica per individuare al primo colpo la zona da toccare. Inoltre se ad esempio decidiamo di toglierci gli auricolari, dobbiamo maneggiarli con attenzione per evitare di dare qualche comando involontario. Di fatto nel momento in cui si smette di usarli conviene sempre rimetterli nella custodia.Con l'app si possono gestire anche altre funzioni oltre all'equalizzatore come la cancellazione del rumore, il volume della propria voce durante le telefonate (quanto ne deve rientrare negli auricolari attraverso il microfono) e altre funzioni come il ""talkthru"" che però trovo poco pratico da usare.La cancellazione del rumore l'ho dovuta disattivare, per cui la considero inesistente. L'ho disattivata perchè con questa funzione attiva i microfoni sono accesi e mentre camminavo all'aperto ascoltando musica mi entravano i rumori del vento rendendo l'ascolto disturbato. Tolta l'opzione la musica torna ""pulita"" e anche se l'ambiente si percepisce credo che sia meglio così. Essere totalmente isolati mentre si cammina per strada penso non sia il massimo per questioni di sicurezza.Un difetto importante che forse però è difficile da risolvere sta nel fatto che gli auricolari una volta accesi possono essere spenti solamente in due modi: riponendoli nella custodia o tramite app. Se però vengono spenti dall'app non si possono più riaccendere fino a che non vengono rimessi nella custodia e tolti nuovamente. Per cui una volta spenti se non abbiamo la custodia a portata di mano non sono più utilizzabili. Probabilmente il problema sta nei comandi touch: con altri auricolari economici con tasto fisico bastava tenere premuto sia per spegnerli che per riaccenderli.I comandi touch sono personalizzabili tramite app ma fino ad un certo punto. Ovvero posso decidere che il volume venga controllato dall'auricolare sinistro e i comandi stop/play/avanti ecc da quello destro ma non posso ad esempio decidere quanti click servano per alzare il volume o per abbassarlo. I comandi sono quelli decisi in fabbrica e rimangono quelli. La custodia è piccola e gli auricolari si mantengono bene in carica perchè attratti da una calamita, cosa anche questa che fa molto ""figo"". Non c'è quindi possibilità di posizionarli in modo errato e non caricarli (come capita con auricolari economici). Forse l'unico difetto è nella finitura della plastica, un po' troppo liscia e quindi un po' scivolosa.Gli auricolari hanno una spia che si accende quando entrano modalità accoppiamento e che si spegne durante l'uso (ottimo perchè di notte ad esempio due luci che lampeggiano continuamente sono molto fastidiose in un ambiente buio). Si accendono per qualche istante quanto vengono messi e tolti dalla custodia, di fatto quindi non ci sono indicazioni sullo stato di carica e non sappiamo se sono al 100% o stanno ancora caricando.In conclusione mi sento di consigliare questi auricolari perchè senza spendere una fortuna si ha qualcosa che funziona bene e serve allo scopo per cui è progettata. Nel mio caso avendo usato un buono di 50 euro mi sono costate meno di 22 euro e le considero un mega affare. Dopo averle usate qualche settimana però ritengo che anche al loro prezzo pieno (circa 75 euro) siano comunque un buon affare.Ah... Tutto ok anche per le telefonate. Il volume è ottimo e si parla senza problemi con l'interlocutore che non ha difficoltà ad ascoltarci.    "

Forse per sport estremi, molto movimentati, potrebbero non essere l'ideale, ma in ogni caso suppongo che la cosa possa variare da persona a persona per via della forma delle orecchie diversa per ognuno di noi.La durata della batteria è eccellente e considerando che dopo ogni uso, riponendoli nella custodia, gli auricolari si caricano, praticamente ogni volta che li usiamo li troviamo al 100% di batteria. Dovrebbero durare circa 8 ore in uso continuato ma non sono mai riuscito a scaricarli completamente per cui non posso dare conferma. In ogni caso 10 minuti di carica garatisce 2 ore di batteria, per cui riuscire a scaricarli del tutto e non poterli utilizzare è una operazione quasi impossibile. Chiaramente la custodia deve essere sempre a portata di mano, altrimenti la ricarica è impossibile. Sulla custodia c'è un led che si accende per qualche secondo ogni volta che gli aricolari vengono tolti o messi in carica e indica la quantità di batteria residua della custodia stessa: verde, arancione o rossa  a seconda della quantità di batteria residua. Con la custodia è possibile avere altre 3 cariche complete, quindi sommando alle 8 ore degli auricolari diventano 30 ore di autonomia (dichiarate).Il suono è molto buono, i bassi si sentono bene ed è comunque possibile modificare l'equalizzazione attraverso un app.La connessione al dispositivo è praticamente immediata: il tempo di togliere gli auricolari dalla custodia e di indossarli e sono già connessi e funzionanti. Possono essere usati anche separatamente.E' possibile gestire sia il play/pausa/avanti/indietro durante l'ascolto della musica che il volume, oltre all'immancabile assitente vocale che personalmente non uso quindi non ho provato.I comandi sono touch e questo è un bene e un male allo stesso tempo. Un bene perchè gli auricolari sono più ""puliti"" esteticamente e perchè i comandi touch danno comunque l'idea di qualcosa di un livello più alto rispetto a roba più economica. Il lato negativo è che non è poi così semplice da utilizzare un comando touch da effettuare su qualcosa che non si vede (lo si fa ovviamente alla cieca durante l'uso) per cui bisogna fare pratica per individuare al primo colpo la zona da toccare. Inoltre se ad esempio decidiamo di toglierci gli auricolari, dobbiamo maneggiarli con attenzione per evitare di dare qualche comando involontario. Di fatto nel momento in cui si smette di usarli conviene sempre rimetterli nella custodia.Con l'app si possono gestire anche altre funzioni oltre all'equalizzatore come la cancellazione del rumore, il volume della propria voce durante le telefonate (quanto ne deve rientrare negli auricolari attraverso il microfono) e altre funzioni come il ""talkthru"" che però trovo poco pratico da usare.La cancellazione del rumore l'ho dovuta disattivare, per cui la considero inesistente. L'ho disattivata perchè con questa funzione attiva i microfoni sono accesi e mentre camminavo all'aperto ascoltando musica mi entravano i rumori del vento rendendo l'ascolto disturbato. Tolta l'opzione la musica torna ""pulita"" e anche se l'ambiente si percepisce credo che sia meglio così. Essere totalmente isolati mentre si cammina per strada penso non sia il massimo per questioni di sicurezza.Un difetto importante che forse però è difficile da risolvere sta nel fatto che gli auricolari una volta accesi possono essere spenti solamente in due modi: riponendoli nella custodia o tramite app. Se però vengono spenti dall'app non si possono più riaccendere fino a che non vengono rimessi nella custodia e tolti nuovamente. Per cui una volta spenti se non abbiamo la custodia a portata di mano non sono più utilizzabili. Probabilmente il problema sta nei comandi touch: con altri auricolari economici con tasto fisico bastava tenere premuto sia per spegnerli che per riaccenderli.I comandi touch sono personalizzabili tramite app ma fino ad un certo punto. Ovvero posso decidere che il volume venga controllato dall'auricolare sinistro e i comandi stop/play/avanti ecc da quello destro ma non posso ad esempio decidere quanti click servano per alzare il volume o per abbassarlo. I comandi sono quelli decisi in fabbrica e rimangono quelli. La custodia è piccola e gli auricolari si mantengono bene in carica perchè attratti da una calamita, cosa anche questa che fa molto ""figo"". Non c'è quindi possibilità di posizionarli in modo errato e non caricarli (come capita con auricolari economici). Forse l'unico difetto è nella finitura della plastica, un po' troppo liscia e quindi un po' scivolosa.Gli auricolari hanno una spia che si accende quando entrano modalità accoppiamento e che si spegne durante l'uso (ottimo perchè di notte ad esempio due luci che lampeggiano continuamente sono molto fastidiose in un ambiente buio). Si accendono per qualche istante quanto vengono messi e tolti dalla custodia, di fatto quindi non ci sono indicazioni sullo stato di carica e non sappiamo se sono al 100% o stanno ancora caricando.In conclusione mi sento di consigliare questi auricolari perchè senza spendere una fortuna si ha qualcosa che funziona bene e serve allo scopo per cui è progettata. Nel mio caso avendo usato un buono di 50 euro mi sono costate meno di 22 euro e le considero un mega affare. Dopo averle usate qualche settimana però ritengo che anche al loro prezzo pieno (circa 75 euro) siano comunque un buon affare.Ah... Tutto ok anche per le telefonate. Il volume è ottimo e si parla senza problemi con l'interlocutore che non ha difficoltà ad ascoltarci.    "

There is no noise cancellation, in fact, these are quite the opposite and have settings to make you even more aware of your surroundings. The sound is crystal clear, the bass is nice and soft but not too boomy, as someone who has a subwoofer in my car I would like a lot more but it's just impossible from these type of buds, unless you want to buy some silicone tips for them but that would just beat the purpose. Inside the app you can play around with the settings and find what suits you best. They are light, comfortable and in my honest opinion they sound great for what they are. They charge quick too.Are they worth £45? Well, I've had better sounding buds for the same price but they were completely different type, this time I wanted the airpod type and I am happy with the purchase as they met my expectations, can't go wrong with JBL. Bought a pair of Ankers for £16 too but looks like they will go in the drawer for the future. I do recommend this to anyone looking for a simple pair of good quality buds.  "

"256","MOONDROP CHU II High Performance Dynamic Driver IEMs Interchangeable Cable in-Ear Headphone  ","N Mor","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Poland on 8 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I've been sporting the Airpods Pro for the last couple of years, but lost it during a road trip. I absolutely loved the sound Airpods Pro produced with the 'Rock' apple music EQ and the 'brightness' on minimum in the accessibility setting; high treble and clear mids with a weak bass (compromise for clarity). It is a must for me to hear the 'fine' details in music, and so as a broke student in college who absolutely needed bluetooth earbuds, I came across these via recommendations on other websites.I gave these a shot because the internet seemed to praise the Moondrop Space Travel's drivers. The case and pods themselves are light (to be expected as they are made of plastic.) That's not to say that they feel and are built cheap- The case build reminds me of an iPhone power adapter.As for the ANC and Passthrough; majority of the reviews I read stated that they were pretty useless. However, I was taken aback when ANC engaged by itself. They are not AT ALL useless. While it seems to struggle with higher-pitched noises, ANC cancels low-medium drone noises such as fans, air conditioning, etc. very well. I would even say they're just as good as Airpod Pros (although I have had mine for a couple years so effectiveness has probably dwindled, take that with a grain of salt.) With the passthrough, you can definitely distinguish between having it off and having it on. The sound that passes through is about as good as having Airpods 1 on- There's the feeling of having something in your ear but due to the imperfect seal the sound passes through fairly easily. Don't let that discourage you though, it's still a great feature.Now to the REAL meat and bones of the show- the sound quality. It's GREAT. One of the best earbuds I've owned. Insane. Quality. Amazing. Need I say more? They rival the sound quality of Gen. 1 Airpod Pros. Treble and mids are clear, the bass is punchy, there's a wide and great soundstage, you can hear each instrument independently yet they all merge in blissful harmony. It's insanely good for it's price tag (And not to brag but, I got them for $10 because of rewards ;-) )  I was actually fairly surprised at how great the bass was as well. With the EQ settings in my airpods pros, the bass was fairly weak but treble and mids are more important to me so I had to compromise. With my personal EQ settings and these headphones I'm getting clear treble with punchy bass.The app feels incomplete and doesn't seem to have manual EQ adjustment as others suggest, that's something that may have to be adjusted via your music app or device. However, they give you multiple ways to adjust your earbud's touch function which is really nice. I only have them on for 2-3 hours at a time, so battery life hasn't been a problem yet.Time will tell how durable these are, but I'm incredibly satisfied. I rarely give out such detailed reviews, but these truly deserve it. Go grab a pair!  "

Light and comfortable. Clear mids and highs that distort sometimes at louder volumes. Lacks bass. Low to average battery life relative to the entire field but not bad for the price bracket. Fiddly to replace buds into charging case, but cool 90s anime design. Audio feedback is an anime girl voice which might be annoying for some. Only single status LED. Touch area was not 100% consistent detecting touches but got it right most of the time. Noise cancelling not the best but better than expected at this price. Picks up and passes through wind noise a lot, but fine for indoor/stationary use. A couple of fit and finish gripes here and there, and doesn't look like it would take to sweat or water splash too well, but can't complain for the price.Phone app was not on google play and required sideloading so don't bother. Default settings are fine. YouTube video sync lags a bit when connected to standalone APTx TaoTronics transmitter (TT-BA08), but works fine directly to android phone.Had a weird connection issue where one channel would cut out for a moment, then come back. Could possibly be interference from BT signal traffic of other nearby devices, not really sure.These would make an amazing gift.  "

Sound is good, app works well (you need to download the .apk from moondrops homepage at the time of writing this).Battery life is so-so, but you have plenty of charge in the case.But the case....*Charge port is on the bottom - not too smart*No lid - dirt will enter and accumulate over time. The ""wells"" the headphones sit in is deep and narrow, so the contact points are very hard to clean. Bad connections is eminent after a couple of months use.* No lid - although the magnets hold the headphones in place fairly well, if you put it in a pocket or bag, you will constantly get connections from the moondrops while moving. This can be very annoying if you're using other headphones, but especially so if talking on the phone at the time this happens. Also you might need to search for a lost headphone in your bag once in a while.The leather case you can buy for them seems to be of really bad quality, so I wouldn't suggest getting that, BUT there are some really nice 3d-files out there to print, that seem to solve or minimize the problems with the case.Either way, if you enjoy good sounding items I would still recommend them. If you need 3+ hours of battery life and want some really punchy bass, you might want to look at some Sonys or something instead, but at this price range, I seriously doubt you'll find anything better. Probably not at double the price either.TL;DR: Sound good. Case and battery bad. Still worth. Also I think they look cool.  "

The tuning is very good, as expected from Moondrop (I own a pair of Arias myself). I find myself enjoying both kpop and rap out of theseThe sound is supposedly basically the same as the Nekocake. Soundstage and imaging are decent, you can make out where the instruments are coming from. Vocals are natural sounding. Bass is powerful, I would think that the average consumer would love it, but it might be too much for some audiophiles I suppose. Treble is energetic but not fatiguing (ahem KZ)The app (I tested it on the Apple App Store) allows you to change the tuning with three presets, but I would just leave it as the reference setting. You can also change the tap functions, but default is fine enough. Just wish I could double tap *either* earbuds to skip and triple tap to go back, like AirPods ProWhich brings me to my comparison to the AirPods Pro Gen 1, which I own. I got these Space Travels since my AirPods had been giving me issues lately, like connectivity and static. Anyway, these sound better than the AirPods right out of the box. The noise cancelling on the Space Travel works for sure, you can feel the ""sucking effect"" in your ear, just like any ANC headphones. Obviously it's not as strong as my Bose 700 or AirPods Pro, but it's effective enough with some music playing. The transparency mode works... but it doesn't feel that much different from when it's off. Nothing will beat the AirPods Pro with Transparency Mode, but these do come a little close to Bose 700 transparency.There is no lid, yes, but the magnets are very strong and you cannot shake out the buds. Dust and lint might get in the case if the buds are out? That's really the flaw here.I just really do wish these had multipoint pairing, where I could use these with both my laptop and phone. Speaking of, when you first connect these to a Windows laptop, they're recognized as like a calling device so the audio quality is terrible and very loud. I think that may just be a Windows thing; they're never good with bluetooth anyway... Pairing is very flawless with these anyway, no complaints  "

Möchte man also einen V-Sound, so muss man sich einen externen Equalizer herunterladen, um ein wenig Bass genießen zu können.Akku:Ich persönlich nutze die Kopfhörer in der Bahn auf dem Weg zur und von der Uni (jeweils ca 2h), weshalb ich über die Akkuleistung der Kopfhörer nicht viel sagen kann. Das Case muss ich je nach Nutzung dann alle 1-2 Wochen laden.Qualität:Es ist zwar alles aus Kunststoff, jedoch fühlt dieser sich keineswegs billig an. Alles passt genau wie es soll. Einzig das Reinstecken sowie Herausnehmen der Kopfhörer aus dem Case ist... fragwürdig? Es ist jedenfalls nicht intuitiv und führte einmal dazu, dass meine Kopfhörer auf den Boden gefallen sind.ANC:In der Bahn merkt man auf jeden Fall einen Unterschied: das leise Summen und Brummen verschwindet quasi komplett. Die Gespräche anderer werden nicht unterdrückt, Windgeräusche sogar verstärkt.Verbindung:Obwohl die Kopfhörer Bluetooth 5.3 besitzen, supporten diese leider nur bis zu SBC/AAC (320kBit/s), was mich enttäuscht. Die Verbindung hatte bisher nur zwei mal Probleme und der ""Gaming""-Modus mit einer Latenz von 55ms ist auf jeden Fall brauchbar.Fazit:Meckern auf sehr hohem Niveau!

Good fit and seal and only fall out with excessive headbanging.The sound is very good! Maybe even better than my old Jaybird Vistas. Decent bass and voices are nice and clear. The ANC is very good and even at my noise workplace the ANC works excellent. They passive isolation however isn't that good on their own.Sound pass trough modes add a lot of hissing in a high noise environment, so that is one downside.One weak spot for the ANC is high frequenzies emitted by things like ultrasonic cleaners. I can't get within 2 meters of my tiny cleaner with any of the ANC/pass features, it starts crackling like crazy static.The battery is pretty damn good. I get about 3 1/2 to 4h with ANC+playback, ANC always on and playback sometimes paused for talk.BT connectivity has been flawless so far, but calls have been a hit and miss. Some people say it's good, some can't understand me clearly.One big issue is the controlls and audio featback. You have audio prompts when switching between modes or low battery. Hower, even in a quiet room you don't hear anything. Way to quiet, as if a baby is whispering you thing across a room... and no way to make it louder.The controlls are touch on the stem. I manage to play/pause/skip about every other tap.So far my rating for the buds themself:- Sound 8/10- Battery 8/10- ANC 6.5/10- Passtrough 4/10- BT 10/10- Calls 6/10- Fit 7/10- Prompts/controlls 3/10Now the big pill of poop that is the charging case. It looks good, is crap. It's not covering your buds, so they get lint all over them. It's a paint to get the buds in and out since you have to slide in the stem all the way down and not have it tillt. Taking them out is only possible by shaking or squezing the stem to the top, which can active some functions like change track or dissable ANC untril you manage them out somehow...Very ugly engineering here.But for the price... you don't get any better buds imo.

The noise cancelling and transparency mode work fairly well which is an absolute miracle at this price range. The battery life is fantastic between the earbuds and the case and they come with a good range of ear tip sizes. Unfortunately these have on and off latency issues so watching any sort of video the audio and visuals will be off by about half a second which is pretty considerable, even in low latency game mode. This latency issue can usually be resolved either by toggling between the two latency modes or by placing them in the case and reconnecting. It usually comes back within ten or fifteen minutes so that makes watching movies with them pretty unpleasant. Overall these are a really great value and if you plan on just using them for music or tuning out an airplane they are a definite buy.

The case was also fun to fidget with. I had issues with the noise cancelation, where it would always turn off or wasn't calibrated correctly everytime I put them in. The headphones would also lose signal every so often and go silent for a second.Ear 2 (black):I wanted to upgrade as I heard they fixed and upgraded a lot of the features.Noise cancelation: The noise cancelation now has a few more modes and keeps the setting you chose! A neat feature now is when you take one Ear bud out, it automatically switches the other ear bud to transparent mode until you put the other ear bud back in. These aren't quite as good as my Bose QC35 noise cancelation but do work quite well especially at the gym.Sound: After directly comparing these to the ear 1s, the sound on the ear 2 is noticeable better. The ear 2 also has a customizable EQ in the app. Music and audiobooks are clearer. These also don't have the issue of the first ear 1s where it would lose connection to my phone every once in a while.Ear buds: still fit great, comes with 3 bud sizes. They still look dope. The touch buttons have now been replaced with squeeze pressure sensors which remove accidental presses. They also play a satisfying feedback click noise.Case: still sleek, and fun to fidget with. Love the materials they used. Crispier edges. LolCost: The cost is reasonable, these aren't cheap but they won't blow the bank.Cons: here are a few of my only cons.- The noises when switching noise cancelation modes or connecting can be abrasively high-pitched/loud at times. (Wish we could adjust these)- Requires a lot of cleaning depending on how much ear wax you produce lol, especially for the case since you can see through it.  "

Why not?Imagine my surprise when I put them in my ear and they felt secure and comfortable.....even my right ear! I didn't feel like it was going to fall out. I didn't have to futz with the buds. I put them in and they stayed.Connecting was as much of a breeze as the Airpods. There's an app for them.Let me tell you about the SOUND!.....After my delight at the fit I thought I'd be disappointed in the sound but I was blown away! Noise cancelling was great and the sound was so rich and full with great separation. Sound quality was right up there with the Airpods, even better I'd say. Such a relief!!Don't sleep on these!

This is because these earbuds blow away anything in the same price range to the point where it's just competing with the more expensive brands. That should tell you everything you need to know.Sound quality is great! Noise reduction and passthrough is decent, just behind Airpods, but amazing nonetheless especially when considering all other buds in this price range don't have that at all.The app is pretty good, I would say the only downsides is the battery life which is roughly about 3 hours on the buds themselves.Other negative is the beautiful bud case with the clear lexan plastic isn't going to stay beautiful for long. While it doesn't easily scratch, it's going to get scratched up. If you don't care much about that then it isn't a big deal. The layout of the case is really nice, I love how I can just drop the buds in and the magnet pulls them into place.Are you going to get something better in this price range? Probably not unless Apple AirPods go on sale for about half off.  "

I need to reduce the bass level for certain songs. Stereo signals are good.- Noise cancelling function: appears to work when using with the app downloaded and installed to my phone.- It can withstand the sweat from my gym sessions.What I don't like:- Control button is not working in the way it is planned: I use the app and set up the button however the button on the left ear for switching among normal, noise cancelling, transparent works fine. However, the button on the right ears do not work even I keep pressing on, twice or hold. It completely does not work. I have to use my phone if I want to forward or go back to the music track. However I don't need this function when I use this earbuds.I have not tried the call function as I buy this earbuds just for my gym and I want to block the noises and just focus on my gym.Overall I recommend it based on its value and design and the functions it offers  "

Ok... I just opened the box, inspected everything and tried these earbuds on for the first time.  This is what I found within the first 30min.First off, the Good!1. I had no problem linking/syncing these earbuds to my phone and have had no problem being away from the case. (Someone mentioned that they had to be next to the case for the earbuds to function properly in their review. )2. These earbuds are light and comfortable with the addition of the large ear pieces needed for my ears. The pre-installed mediums were to small, allowing the earbuds to fall out.3. The sound is crisp and clear.4. The case is small and sleek with the nice addition of a magnetic button pop lid and a seperate button that allows you to see the case charge lights, located at the rear of the case next to the Type-C charging port.5. The design of these earbuds is sleek and stylish as well with the slight addition of red and blue accent colors. Just enough to create a glamorous appeal to a potential, visually boring product.6. The button on each earbud is easy to push, however it may be hard for individuals with fat fingers/large hands. My only recommendation in regards to the button would be for Anker not to place it next to the over ear swing mechanism.The Bad!1. Like most pairs of Anker earbuds, the volume is very low, which is probably 60% of consumer complaints. I personally have sent back 2 or so pairs due to this issue alone.2. I had to download the Anker app just to boost the volume and it is still not very loud except for certain tones.3. The physical box these came in, the description on the Amazon site, Anker site and all other retail sites, indicate that these earbuds have ""Body-Moving Bass via a Dynamic Acoustic System"". I think it should say... Ear-Puncturing Treble if you want to be able to hear music outside of a quiet place! Where is the Bass that you so proudly suggest these earbuds posses?Without the volume at the very highest level I could possibly get it to be (alone with nothing making noise in my home), the music sounds clear and crisp but still has barely any bass. When the volume is at the highest level, all you hear is Treble for the most part and certain tones could almost be considered ear drum piercing.4. The piece that hangs over the front upper part of your ears are flimsy and short, with absolutely no way to mold them to your ears, making them pretty much useless. Even with the large ear inserts installed for my ears, I can still shake these out of my ears like any regular pair of earbuds (without an over ear hook), with very little effort.Overall, the price was not a bank account killer and they are initially, way better than Ankers Spirit X2, which I immediately sent back and later recieved an apology from Anker for. I have no idea how the Anker AeroFit's are and probably never will, due to the price. I will probably buy a pair of the Beats instead of spending only $20 to $30 less, for a potential letdown from Anker. I will update this review as necessary as I continue utilizing and testing them out.  "
"374","Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs  ","Arek","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 9 February 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","        I quite like the Anker Soundcore Sport X10.  This product is far from perfect, but it's pretty good overall.  It's a bargain at this price point, but has some annoyances.For music, these earbuds are excellent.  They have good bass and should satisfy most music listeners.  Volume is plenty loud.When it comes to ANC, these earbuds aren't that great. It's just ok.  ANC does work, but it's probably only able to eliminate about half the background noises when you're lstening to music unless you've increased the sound volume.When making or receiving phone calls, the mic performance is generally adequate. it's not going to win any awards but it gets the job done.  Indoors it's more than fine.  Outdoors, the mic performance is fine if there aren't too many cars around, but on a more windy day, the the mic sometimes struggles.  Background noises do get filtered out, but only to a certain extent.  Most of the times, it's fine, but callers will know that you're outside while in a call when you're using these earbuds.The control buttons are pretty bad.  I don't think that anyone will want to use these.  They are too small to be of any use and the ear hooks get in the way.  It's easier to just control everything earbud related from your phone.The ear hooks are an annoyance, but you'll probably get used to them.  Depending on how tight of a fit you get, usage of these earbuds may be possible without needing to fold out the hooks.  Unfrotuantely, the hooks aren't dettachable.  Also, I didn't find these earbuds to be as comfortable as Anker would have customers believe and did notice some soreness after using these for a few hours.Battery wise, the earbuds are a disappointment. The battery life is actually okay, but once again, Anker greatly exaggerates by advertising 8 hours of battery life.  While some other manufactuers give more realistic battery estimates, I've found that Anker markets numbers that aren't even close.  I would say to only expect about 5 hours of battery out of these.I rated this product as an overall 3 out of 5 stars. It's actually better than that, but it's not qutie a 4 star product becasue of some of the negative aspects.  It's more like a 3.5 star item.  "

I am not too sure.The equaliser app is a great option and does make a big difference to the overall sound quality. HOWEVER, for some ridiculous reason, you cannot use it unless BOTH ear buds are out!?

I own the Shure SE846's, I own Sennheiser 598/600/650's with a dedicated amp and dac. I also own the Sony WF-1000 XM4s and have owned the Jaybird Vistas, used the Jabra Elite 7 Pros, owned Samsung galaxy buds, tried the Shokz bone conduction headphones. You get the point. This isn't to brag about an extensive collection, moreso to at least lend some credence to my rating. I've been around the block when it comes to audio.Summary:These earbuds feel about right for what you're paying for. Which means what it means. You're going to get earbuds that stay in, can be abused, and have decent sound quality. They're nothing special as in it's not like you're getting a hell of a deal on sound quality or active noise cancelation, but, they're just fine. If I'm being honest, maybe slightly overpriced, feels like they should be about 5-10 dollars cheaper at around 60 dollar earbuds. If you're invested into sound quality, definitely look at earbuds in a higher price range. I wish I could recommend other earbuds in this price bracket but these are the only ones I've purchased around this price point. Do I regret my purchase? A little bit, but, once I've gotten into my workout I don't necessarily need the best of the best in sound quality, that's what I have my other headphones for.Audio:The audio is fine. It's bass heavy, but that's literally part of the item description. Messing with the EQ doesn't remove the muddiness of the sound. I'm more of a guy who enjoys pronounced mids and clear highs with crispy bass so these are definitely not my kind of ear bud. Yet, for the price, it's not bad. Not fantastic, but not bad.Build Quality:These feel kind of cheap for their price point. Not to the point where I'm scared to abuse them, more the case and and charging magnets. It feels like an after thought. Although I do enjoy the click open cover. I think if they had to skimp on quality to keep the price low they picked the best place to do it since you're not going to be listening to music with a case lol. The magnets do feel pretty weak like they might not create a proper connection if the earbuds aren't seated correctly, but not weak enough that it would be a frequent issue if ever. Maybe like a rare occurrence or something that would happen after a few years of owning these.Noise cancellation:It's pretty bad. If you're looking for ANC capable earbuds, you're not gonna find it at this price point. Feels like it's just added on in order to claim they have ANC since if you don't have that nowadays you're not competitive. So, on paper they have ANC, in reality you'll just be hearing external noises through a compressed mic if you're looking to only use the ANC function of these. In conjuction with music? To be honest, just keep the ANC off it'll save battery life and won't make a difference. The physical seal of the earbuds is good enough to where ANC isn't needed. The difference is laughable, they'd be better off not having added the feature, but I get it. Marketing.  "

Zuerst kommt die Verarbeitung: Plastik ohne irgendwelche Gummibeschichtungen, aber fühlt sich jetzt nicht billig an. Der Deckel vom Case ist transparent ( was 0 Vorteile bringt), ist leicht gefedert und öffnet sich beim Drücken auf den Button vorne, der in hochglanz gehalten ist und die 3 LEDs beim Schließen und öffnen anzeigt. Das Case ist nur einbisschen größer, als das der Soundcore life a 1 und ein kleines Stück größer als das der Soundcore a3i. Die In ears sind gut verarbeitet, der Bügel besteht ist einer Gummischicht und muss von Innen nach außen am Soundcore-Logo entlang gedreht werden. Die Kopfhörer haben soeine leicht kurvige Form, weswegen man sie leicht ins Ohr einsetzen kann. Die Buttons sind seitlich oben (wenn man die in ears im Ohr hat) und lassen sich mäßig drücken. Es liegen 4 zusätzliche Siliconaufsätze bei und ich musste die Größten nehmen, obwohl mir für gewöhnlich die mittleren (M) passen. Ich bin Metalhead und Kraftsportler und bei mir fallen die nicht aus dem Ohr (soll schon was heißen........). Sound: gut, aber leise.Mein Tipp: Alles beim EQ in der App ganz hochschrauben und gegebenenfalls Lautstärke etwas erhöhen. Die App hat viele Funktionen (Equalizer, Steuerung, Atmung, Umgebungsgeräusche. Die Umgebungsgeräusche bringen sogut wie nichts. Habe mit in ears in den Ohren den Wasserhahn voll aufgedreht. Bei normal klingt es voll und dumpf, beim ANC klingt es genauso laut aber höher (rauscht stärker) und beim Transparenzmodus klingt es in etwa so, wie bei normal nur nicht so dumpf (offener, als wären die in ears durchlässig). Ich hoffe, ihr habt es einigermaßen verstanden. Der letzte Punkt: Die Microphones sind auch gut .Fazit:Negativ: leiser Sound (lässt sich aber beheben(, die zu kleinen Silikonaufsätze und die Umgebungsgeräusche, ab und zu verzehrtes Klangbild. Neutral: Verarbeitung, ANC, DruckknöpfePositiv: Ohrhacken, Deckel mit Federung, Knopf zum Öffnen des Deckels, App, Sound nach Regulierung, Micros. Ein Stück ist abgebrochen, obwohl sie nie bei mir runtergefallen sind, was für schlechte Qualität steht. Ich will einen Ersatz.Noch was für die, die andere In ears von Soundcore besitzen: Der Vorteil dieser In ears sind nur die Hacken. Hätten die Soundcore a3i wings, Bügel oder Hacken, hätte ich mir diese hier nicht geholt. Wenn ihr die Gelegenheit habt, irgendwie an die Soundcore a3i Ohrhacken oder Bügel anzubringen, tut das und spart euch das Geld. Diese In Ears sind die UVP auf keinen Fall wert.So, ich hoffe, ich konnte euch damit helfen.Chapeau da dafür und viel Erfolg für eusch, Spottfreunde👍🪝Mal n kleiner Nachtrag: ich benutze diese in ears nun seit Anfang Dezember 2023 und hatte bis jetzt 2 Mal den Vorfall, dass die In ears sich nicht automatisch entkoppelt haben beim reinlegen ins Case. Dies hatte zur Folge, dass meine in ears im Case waren, ich auf dem Smartphone ein Video schauen wollte und mich gewundert habe, warum zum Teufel aus den Lautsprechern keine Töne rauskommen. Des is ne absolute Freschscheit. 100€ UVP...........Soundcore! Ist das euer Ernst jetzt? Warum kriegt ihr keine  zufriedenstellenden In ears hin? Es ist doch so einfach..........laut genug, große und gute Tasten mit nem guten Feedback, die man nicht verfehlen kann, APTX, Wireless Charging und automatische Entkopplung beim Reinlegen ins Case und kein verzehrtes Klangbild. Hätten diese in ears all das zusätzlich zu den Vorteilen, die sie jetzt haben, wäre es mir ohne nachzudenken, 5 Sterne wert. Ich verlange Ersatz oder Geld zurück, auf Grund der Verarbeitung und des Verzehren Klangbild. Ich bin mit diesen In Ears nicht zufrieden. Habe sie nur wegen den Bügeln. Eure Soundcore a 3i sind definitiv besser.    "

Stört es wirklich niemanden, dass man wenn der rechte Kopfhörer wegen Akkumangel eher ausfällt als der Linke, dass man dann mit dem linken verbliebenen nur noch leiser stellen kann, da die laut und leise Funktion auf jeweils nur einer Seite zur Verfügung steht (linke Seite für leise, rechte Seite für laut. Sowas geht garnicht.Wieso wird von einigen Nutzern behauptet, dass er vergleichbar mit einem Apple Kopfhörer ist. Wenn er einmal mit einem IPhone per Bluetooth verbunden ist, man das Gerät sperrt und dann zum IPad wechselt, wartet man vergeblich darauf, dass er sich mit dem IPad, mit dem er schon einmal verbunden war, erneut verbindet. Vielmehr muss vorher die Verbindung manuell getrennt werden oder eben Bluetooth ausgeschaltet werden.Auch wird nur der Ladezustand des gesamten LadeCases angezeigt und nicht pro Seite. Das geht auch anders. Also nix mit Apple tauglich…Was ich ebenfalls als sehr schlimm empfand ist die Tatsache, dass die Bügel 1. schwenkbar ( welches Ohr benötigt 210 Grad, damit wird sogar geworben) und 2. viel zu kurz sind.Durch die Möglichkeit des Schwenkens der Ohrbügel wird das Ladecase kleiner und somit kann der Akku darin auch baulich nicht besonders groß ausgelegt werden.Zusätzlich bedeutet es einen höheren Zeitaufwand beim Herausnehmen und wieder hineinlegen (zum Laden), denn ohne die Bügel zu klappen, kann man sie nicht  an den Ohren befestigen. Einfach viel zu fummelig. Rein von der Anatomie des Ohres könnten die Bügel um Einiges länger sein, auch käme das dem Halt am Ohr sehr zugute. Ich wage zu behaupten, dass jeder schlechtere Kabel gebundene Sportkopfhörer längere Bügel hat, warum wohl…Der Druckpunkt der Lautstärketasten ist viel zu straff. Ohne dass man auf der Gegenseite einen Finger dagegen drückt, sind sie nicht bedienbar, ohne das sie weggedrückt werden. Positiv ist die Tatsache, dass die Taster (wie bereits erwähnt, leider nur einer pro Seite) relativ weit herausstehen und somit gut zu finden sind.Da ich das Tragen einer Brille in Verbindung mit Ohrbügel-Kopfhörern bereits gewöhnt bin, haben mich die Bügel zusammen mit den Brillenbügeln nicht gestört.Leider ist es mir passiert, dass der Akku der rechten Seite mehr als eine Stunde weniger Leistung zur Verfügung hatte als der Linke. Somit wurde mir das Problem mit der Lautstärkeregelung erst richtig bewusst. Natürlich könnte man sagen, dass man ja nicht so oft regeln muss, aber wenn man nur eine Seite benötigt, ist keine Regelung in beide Richtungen möglich. Welcher Exoerte hat sich sowas ausgedacht. Die Angabe 32 Stunden Akku suggeriert eine durchgehende Laufzeit. Würde mich interessieren wie Anker sich das denkt, wie das gehen soll kann ich mir nicht vorstellen.Für mich sind das definitiv Gründe für eine Rücksendung. Für momentan 79,99€ hätte ich mir etwas Besseres gewünscht.Vielleicht bin ich auch verwöhnt. Ich hatte zuvor die Powerbeats pro von Dr.Dre, die erfüllen alle Ansprüche. Lautstärkeregelung für laut und leise per Wippe auf jeder Seite, lange Bügel. Vernünftige Ladestandsanzeige für links, rechts und Ladecase im Einzelnen. Ebenfalls einen ordentlichen Klang und automatische Neuverbindung beim Wechsel auf ein anderes Gerät Sie sind aber auch mehr als doppelt so preisintensiv. Ich wollte dieses Mal nicht wieder so viel Geld in die Hand nehmen und wurde sehr enttäuscht.Qualität hat eben ihren Preis.Ich hoffe das hilft dem einen oder anderen Kunden bei der Kaufentscheidung.

Maybe it's just me, but non of the ear tip sizes make any difference. The loop helps stop them falling off but not coming loose and letting more sound in. In the gym, a single shoulder press moved them enough to let all the noise of the gym flood through.Noise cancelling is a scam. The 3 settings just changed the eq settings, raising lower frequencies for NC, lowering it for aware mode. It doesn't work, doesn't make the slightest iota of difference.Volume isn't very high. I've had them on full volume at the gym to try and drown out the horrendous EDM they pump out but it's not quite loud enough. I don't have music on blasting so full volume is about as loud as I actually like it.

So I went for a pair of the X10s which seemed to tick all those boxes and were keenly priced.All was well initially but after what I reckon was no more than 35-40 hours of use, one of the buds stopped working. I tried resetting them, everything I can think of, but it remained dead. I contacted Anker and their customer service was very good; they dispatched out a pair of replacements within a few days.So I started using them and all seemed fine. I picked up an injury so did not run for a few months, so when I next was planning a run I charged them up, popped them in and voila - exactly the same issue as I had had before with one bud working and the other one not, the same one as before on the previous pair.This pair gave me even less life than the first one - maybe 25 hours top - and are not useless. I can't find the box for this pair so I can't even contact Anker seeking a replacement, though not sure I would want a replacement now anyway.I own a number of Anker products and have always got on well with them, however this one is really poor and I would recommend you avoid.

The standard zeroes have excellent audio quality, great comfort, remain in-ear at all times (due to the quite comfortable over the ear hook), and were absurd value for the price.The Zero:2's are all of that still, but they somehow managed to improve the audio quality more.  It's not like the Zeroes are bad by any means, I mean I'm writing this as I have the originals on my head right now.  What I can say though is that you will not be disappointed if you purchase these either as a fresh purchase or upgrades from your existing set.And then there's the price.  I purchased these for roughly $20 USD.  Normally for that price in stores, you'll end up with a pair of earbuds that will stop working in six months.  I have been using the original Zeroes for a year now and have yet to have any hiccups at all with them.The one downside is the cord length.  It is well constructed and highly durable, but it is also on the shorter side.  I use my headphones to go from my desktop mounted workstation to my head.  It's not that far of a distance, maybe 2ft tops.  The length of the cord is roughly 3ft, so that's not bad for most users, and if you're just going from a laptop, handheld, or mobile it's going to be fine.  However if you do have a bit of a longer run, you may want to pick up a headphone extension cable along with this.  "

"417","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","Rick","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Italy on 4 February 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","        These IEMs are simply the best value I've gotten out of $25, compared to all the other earphones I've tried in my life. However, their size and shape are not for everyone.The drivers have a lot of power and very little distortion across the entire range. The bass is clear and well-balanced, complementing the type of mixes found in most electronic and jazz music. The mids are extremely well-polished and do not sound too washed out or too noisy. Finally, the highs are especially crystal-clear while not being too ringy. Overall, these IEMs have helped me get better mixes on the [electronic] tracks I produce.As for the fit, it is excellent, but only for medium to big ear sizes. I have average-sized ears, and these fit perfectly and do not cause any fatigue or long-term pain. However, for my sister whose ears are much smaller than mine, the ear tips barely make it halfway due to the drivers' housing being too large to fit in her ears. I'd say this is also due to them being in this ""iceberg"" shape. I'm sure that the size and shape of the housing has a small amount to do with the sound characteristics, but I feel like something still could have been done for the ergonomics of these IEMs.Finally, the cable is very nice. Certainly much better than all other cables I've experienced on both headphones and earphones. They flow very well and don't tangle so easily, even if I crumple them up or leave them in my pocket. Whenever they do tangle, however, the ability for the cable to detach from the drivers helps immensely in the process of untangling. The small bead that limits the two sides' separation is not too loose and not too tight; I've found myself using it more often than those on other earphones.The only other thing I can say - these being the first cable-over-the-ear IEMs I've used - is that there is certainly a learning curve to determining which side is which and exactly how to put them on. This made for an interesting experience when I first tried to share one side with my siblings.All-in-all, I would strongly recommend this if you want powerful, lush, and balanced-sounding earphones for a very good price, unless your ears are on the smaller side.

Das erweckt beides schonmal keinen guten Eindruck.Das Kabel ist richtig mies, es verknotet sich extrem leicht, riecht dezent nach Gummiboot und mir juckte es nach kürzester Zeit hinter den Ohren.Das selbe gilt für die Tips, zum ersten mal finde ich keine wirklich für mich geeigneten Spitzen in der Box. Diejenigen die ideal passen ohne zu schmerzen klingen für mich am schlechtesten, die mit dem besseren Klang schmerzen und fangen auch nach ein paar Lieder auch an zu jucken. Unterschiedliche Durchmesser der Öffnungen, aber eben nicht so das für jede Größe der selbe Durchmesser vorliegen würde, obendrein völlig unterschiedliche Härtegrade des Materials, planlos zusammengeworfener Müll in meinen Augen...oder Ohren. Das kenne ich so garnicht...und ich hatte schon einige chinesische Earbuds.Zum Klang: getestet mit passenden beiliegenden Spitzen verschiedener Öffnungsdurchmesser, einmal mit Originalkabel und dann mit Tripowin Zonie an einem F.Audio KS01. Klingen nach meinem Geschmack gut, wenn ich auch hier und da mal kurz den Eindruck hatte da ""scheppert"" was, sie werden einen Platz bei mir finden...mit Spitzen und Kabel von einem anderen günstigen IEM...das Zeug was beiliegt ist wirklich für die Tonne...Preis/Leistung wird dadurch merklich geschmälert. Bin enttäuscht das Crinacle seinen Namen in Kombination mit solchem Lieferumfang hergibt abgesehn von den Mankos des Gehäuses.Reudig und ZWINGT zum Ersatz, hätte ich keine Ersatzteile da könnte ich damit nicht anfangen. Schade.Kurz der Vergleich zu den Moondrop Chu 2: diese haben 19 gekostet, 7euro weniger als der reguläre Preis der hier bei Amazon aufgerufen wird. Sie kommen mit einer kleinen Soft-Pouch, einem deutlich weniger labbrigen Kabel (das obendrein geruchsneutral ist und keine Hautreaktionen verursacht) und wie gewohnt mindestens einem paar Spitzen kommt das perfekt sitzt. Die Düsen des Metall-Body lassen sich abschrauben, die Filter somit tauschen/reinigen etc. Klang: natürlich anders, aber auch gut. Das hängt von vielen Faktoren ab und ist zudem auch etwas subjektiv. Preis/Leistung ist bei den Chu 2 aber eben etliche male höher...damit fährt man sicherlich besser wenn einem der Klang gefällt.Daher im Billo-Bereich, klangunabhängig: 3 Sterne für die Zero 2 und 5 für die Chu 2. Wenn ihr euch für diese IEMs noch ein Kabel kaufen müsstet, noch kein Case und keine anderen Spitzen rumliegen habt...spart euch das Geld und kauft direkt etwas anderes das mit brauchbarem ""Zubehör"" kommt.

I heard they had an enhanced bass but it is lower than the Melody's.My personal preference after a few hours listening to my music through each is that for the similar pricing I'd pick the Yinyoo CCZ Melody IEM based on performance, standard of build, cable supplied and looks/finish.I shall keep the Zero 2 for back-up, maybe buy a better longer cable and use them on the PC for gaming.

"424","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","Richard","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 15 February 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","        2/27/24I just got these the other day.I am not an audiophile but I trust Crinacle's opinion. These IEMs sound good to me and I don't hear a real difference between them and the Linsoul KZ ZS10 Pro IEMs I've had for a few months. To be honest I do not like these as much.This product is cheaper than my other set The ZS10s by anywhere between 15 and 25 USD. That money value for the sound is in favor of the Zero:2's but the other features of the IEMs suffer because of the price. The cable in this is a very standard cable similar to the Iphone wired earbuds But I find the cable to be a bit short. The part that wraps around your ear is fine but on my other set of IEMs the cover that is there is of higher quality.I can see myself exchanging the cable in the future but that adds to the cost of buying these in my opinion. I would steer someone to the ZS10s instead and look out for the limited-time deals that are offered on them instead if you are looking for money value.  "

What I'm quite unhappy about is how I lost about 70% of the volume from the right ear, I get that they're £25 but I've seen others mention this and its pretty upsetting because they're now uneven.  "

"428","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ","kevin","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 4 March 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars","        I received a pair of these IEMs a few days ago and was initially quite pleased with the sound. They have a nice, boomy sound for gaming, while also reproducing the higher end of the spectrum well. However, I encountered a few drawbacks. Firstly, the right-side IEM lost about 80% of its volume after I put them in my ears, and even cleaning the filter didn't fix the issue. This happened despite only using them for a few sessions. Secondly, the midrange spectrum would crackle when talking with friends on Discord, even at low volume (around 30%).Despite these issues, when they were working properly, they did sound good for games. If you manage to get a pair without these problems and primarily use them for gaming, I would recommend them for the price.  "

Yes for the price is worth a try. i am still using it.  "

"449","Samsung Type C Wired in-Ear Earphones  ",NA,NA,NA,NA,"        It's hard to think of anything positive about these headphones except that the earpieces look cool and there are lots of swappable colour choices. I started to get a bad feeling when it was so difficult to get them out of the box. It deepened when I had to play hide and seek between Chinese text to find the English instructions. Shouldn't have worried because there wasn't anything essential. I now know that the magnets in them can affect pacemakers though.Personally, I like wired headphones without a mic. When I don a set to listen to music, I never get the urge to answer a call. There's a single set of proprietary cables with a standard 3.5mm 3 conductor plug at the end. Although the earpieces are marked L and R, I couldn't find corresponding markings on the incredibly tiny connectors for each headphone element. The pins in them are about as slender as a sewing needle. It took unusual pressure to lock them in place on the elements themselves. If you break or lose this cable, you'll not be able to go to a big box store to pick up a replacement. They are unique and proprietary.I could not get them to stay in my ears without considerable effort. They kept popping out. I noticed that some of the spare rubber covers appeared to be larger than what it came with. I had so much trouble putting a new one on, I gave up. Oh yeah, then there's the sound quality of these headphones. I listened to orchestral classical, choral, pop and hard rock. No obvious lower register at all and a truncated high end too. Tinny and indistinct pretty much covers it.A genuinely awful set of headphones. Not recommended at all.  "

"506","Bose Ultra Open Earbuds with OpenAudio Technology, Open Ear Wireless Earbuds, Up to 48 Hours of Battery Life, Black  ","N Mor","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Poland on 8 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I've been sporting the Airpods Pro for the last couple of years, but lost it during a road trip. I absolutely loved the sound Airpods Pro produced with the 'Rock' apple music EQ and the 'brightness' on minimum in the accessibility setting; high treble and clear mids with a weak bass (compromise for clarity). It is a must for me to hear the 'fine' details in music, and so as a broke student in college who absolutely needed bluetooth earbuds, I came across these via recommendations on other websites.I gave these a shot because the internet seemed to praise the Moondrop Space Travel's drivers. The case and pods themselves are light (to be expected as they are made of plastic.) That's not to say that they feel and are built cheap- The case build reminds me of an iPhone power adapter.As for the ANC and Passthrough; majority of the reviews I read stated that they were pretty useless. However, I was taken aback when ANC engaged by itself. They are not AT ALL useless. While it seems to struggle with higher-pitched noises, ANC cancels low-medium drone noises such as fans, air conditioning, etc. very well. I would even say they're just as good as Airpod Pros (although I have had mine for a couple years so effectiveness has probably dwindled, take that with a grain of salt.) With the passthrough, you can definitely distinguish between having it off and having it on. The sound that passes through is about as good as having Airpods 1 on- There's the feeling of having something in your ear but due to the imperfect seal the sound passes through fairly easily. Don't let that discourage you though, it's still a great feature.Now to the REAL meat and bones of the show- the sound quality. It's GREAT. One of the best earbuds I've owned. Insane. Quality. Amazing. Need I say more? They rival the sound quality of Gen. 1 Airpod Pros. Treble and mids are clear, the bass is punchy, there's a wide and great soundstage, you can hear each instrument independently yet they all merge in blissful harmony. It's insanely good for it's price tag (And not to brag but, I got them for $10 because of rewards ;-) )  I was actually fairly surprised at how great the bass was as well. With the EQ settings in my airpods pros, the bass was fairly weak but treble and mids are more important to me so I had to compromise. With my personal EQ settings and these headphones I'm getting clear treble with punchy bass.The app feels incomplete and doesn't seem to have manual EQ adjustment as others suggest, that's something that may have to be adjusted via your music app or device. However, they give you multiple ways to adjust your earbud's touch function which is really nice. I only have them on for 2-3 hours at a time, so battery life hasn't been a problem yet.Time will tell how durable these are, but I'm incredibly satisfied. I rarely give out such detailed reviews, but these truly deserve it. Go grab a pair!  "

Light and comfortable. Clear mids and highs that distort sometimes at louder volumes. Lacks bass. Low to average battery life relative to the entire field but not bad for the price bracket. Fiddly to replace buds into charging case, but cool 90s anime design. Audio feedback is an anime girl voice which might be annoying for some. Only single status LED. Touch area was not 100% consistent detecting touches but got it right most of the time. Noise cancelling not the best but better than expected at this price. Picks up and passes through wind noise a lot, but fine for indoor/stationary use. A couple of fit and finish gripes here and there, and doesn't look like it would take to sweat or water splash too well, but can't complain for the price.Phone app was not on google play and required sideloading so don't bother. Default settings are fine. YouTube video sync lags a bit when connected to standalone APTx TaoTronics transmitter (TT-BA08), but works fine directly to android phone.Had a weird connection issue where one channel would cut out for a moment, then come back. Could possibly be interference from BT signal traffic of other nearby devices, not really sure.These would make an amazing gift.  "

Sound is good, app works well (you need to download the .apk from moondrops homepage at the time of writing this).Battery life is so-so, but you have plenty of charge in the case.But the case....*Charge port is on the bottom - not too smart*No lid - dirt will enter and accumulate over time. The ""wells"" the headphones sit in is deep and narrow, so the contact points are very hard to clean. Bad connections is eminent after a couple of months use.* No lid - although the magnets hold the headphones in place fairly well, if you put it in a pocket or bag, you will constantly get connections from the moondrops while moving. This can be very annoying if you're using other headphones, but especially so if talking on the phone at the time this happens. Also you might need to search for a lost headphone in your bag once in a while.The leather case you can buy for them seems to be of really bad quality, so I wouldn't suggest getting that, BUT there are some really nice 3d-files out there to print, that seem to solve or minimize the problems with the case.Either way, if you enjoy good sounding items I would still recommend them. If you need 3+ hours of battery life and want some really punchy bass, you might want to look at some Sonys or something instead, but at this price range, I seriously doubt you'll find anything better. Probably not at double the price either.TL;DR: Sound good. Case and battery bad. Still worth. Also I think they look cool.  "

The tuning is very good, as expected from Moondrop (I own a pair of Arias myself). I find myself enjoying both kpop and rap out of theseThe sound is supposedly basically the same as the Nekocake. Soundstage and imaging are decent, you can make out where the instruments are coming from. Vocals are natural sounding. Bass is powerful, I would think that the average consumer would love it, but it might be too much for some audiophiles I suppose. Treble is energetic but not fatiguing (ahem KZ)The app (I tested it on the Apple App Store) allows you to change the tuning with three presets, but I would just leave it as the reference setting. You can also change the tap functions, but default is fine enough. Just wish I could double tap *either* earbuds to skip and triple tap to go back, like AirPods ProWhich brings me to my comparison to the AirPods Pro Gen 1, which I own. I got these Space Travels since my AirPods had been giving me issues lately, like connectivity and static. Anyway, these sound better than the AirPods right out of the box. The noise cancelling on the Space Travel works for sure, you can feel the ""sucking effect"" in your ear, just like any ANC headphones. Obviously it's not as strong as my Bose 700 or AirPods Pro, but it's effective enough with some music playing. The transparency mode works... but it doesn't feel that much different from when it's off. Nothing will beat the AirPods Pro with Transparency Mode, but these do come a little close to Bose 700 transparency.There is no lid, yes, but the magnets are very strong and you cannot shake out the buds. Dust and lint might get in the case if the buds are out? That's really the flaw here.I just really do wish these had multipoint pairing, where I could use these with both my laptop and phone. Speaking of, when you first connect these to a Windows laptop, they're recognized as like a calling device so the audio quality is terrible and very loud. I think that may just be a Windows thing; they're never good with bluetooth anyway... Pairing is very flawless with these anyway, no complaints  "

Möchte man also einen V-Sound, so muss man sich einen externen Equalizer herunterladen, um ein wenig Bass genießen zu können.Akku:Ich persönlich nutze die Kopfhörer in der Bahn auf dem Weg zur und von der Uni (jeweils ca 2h), weshalb ich über die Akkuleistung der Kopfhörer nicht viel sagen kann. Das Case muss ich je nach Nutzung dann alle 1-2 Wochen laden.Qualität:Es ist zwar alles aus Kunststoff, jedoch fühlt dieser sich keineswegs billig an. Alles passt genau wie es soll. Einzig das Reinstecken sowie Herausnehmen der Kopfhörer aus dem Case ist... fragwürdig? Es ist jedenfalls nicht intuitiv und führte einmal dazu, dass meine Kopfhörer auf den Boden gefallen sind.ANC:In der Bahn merkt man auf jeden Fall einen Unterschied: das leise Summen und Brummen verschwindet quasi komplett. Die Gespräche anderer werden nicht unterdrückt, Windgeräusche sogar verstärkt.Verbindung:Obwohl die Kopfhörer Bluetooth 5.3 besitzen, supporten diese leider nur bis zu SBC/AAC (320kBit/s), was mich enttäuscht.

Good fit and seal and only fall out with excessive headbanging.The sound is very good! Maybe even better than my old Jaybird Vistas. Decent bass and voices are nice and clear. The ANC is very good and even at my noise workplace the ANC works excellent. They passive isolation however isn't that good on their own.Sound pass trough modes add a lot of hissing in a high noise environment, so that is one downside.One weak spot for the ANC is high frequenzies emitted by things like ultrasonic cleaners. I can't get within 2 meters of my tiny cleaner with any of the ANC/pass features, it starts crackling like crazy static.The battery is pretty damn good. I get about 3 1/2 to 4h with ANC+playback, ANC always on and playback sometimes paused for talk.BT connectivity has been flawless so far, but calls have been a hit and miss. Some people say it's good, some can't understand me clearly.One big issue is the controlls and audio featback. You have audio prompts when switching between modes or low battery. Hower, even in a quiet room you don't hear anything. Way to quiet, as if a baby is whispering you thing across a room... and no way to make it louder.The controlls are touch on the stem. I manage to play/pause/skip about every other tap.So far my rating for the buds themself:- Sound 8/10- Battery 8/10- ANC 6.5/10- Passtrough 4/10- BT 10/10- Calls 6/10- Fit 7/10- Prompts/controlls 3/10Now the big pill of poop that is the charging case. It looks good, is crap. It's not covering your buds, so they get lint all over them. It's a paint to get the buds in and out since you have to slide in the stem all the way down and not have it tillt. Taking them out is only possible by shaking or squezing the stem to the top, which can active some functions like change track or dissable ANC untril you manage them out somehow...Very ugly engineering here.But for the price... you don't get any better buds imo.

The ANC does block a whole lot of noise and the noise it tries to block makes it difficult to tell which direction the noise is coming from. The earphones  stick out quite a lot so you're gonna get a lot of wind noise. And the case while neat, makes it kind of herd to pull the earphones out.Overall, these are good if you're indoors, not so great for being outside.  "

The noise cancelling and transparency mode work fairly well which is an absolute miracle at this price range. The battery life is fantastic between the earbuds and the case and they come with a good range of ear tip sizes. Unfortunately these have on and off latency issues so watching any sort of video the audio and visuals will be off by about half a second which is pretty considerable, even in low latency game mode. This latency issue can usually be resolved either by toggling between the two latency modes or by placing them in the case and reconnecting. It usually comes back within ten or fifteen minutes so that makes watching movies with them pretty unpleasant. Overall these are a really great value and if you plan on just using them for music or tuning out an airplane they are a definite buy. If however you intent to use these for movies and television i would maybe look elswhere.  "

The standard zeroes have excellent audio quality, great comfort, remain in-ear at all times (due to the quite comfortable over the ear hook), and were absurd value for the price.The Zero:2's are all of that still, but they somehow managed to improve the audio quality more.  It's not like the Zeroes are bad by any means, I mean I'm writing this as I have the originals on my head right now.  What I can say though is that you will not be disappointed if you purchase these either as a fresh purchase or upgrades from your existing set.And then there's the price.  I purchased these for roughly $20 USD.  Normally for that price in stores, you'll end up with a pair of earbuds that will stop working in six months.  I have been using the original Zeroes for a year now and have yet to have any hiccups at all with them.The one downside is the cord length.  It is well constructed and highly durable, but it is also on the shorter side.  I use my headphones to go from my desktop mounted workstation to my head.  It's not that far of a distance, maybe 2ft tops.  The length of the cord is roughly 3ft, so that's not bad for most users, and if you're just going from a laptop, handheld, or mobile it's going to be fine.  However if you do have a bit of a longer run, you may want to pick up a headphone extension cable along with this.  "

Non sono assolutamente gli auricolari più risoluti, o coi tecnicismi migliori, anzi, siamo sulla sufficienza, ma la loro musicalità, chiarezza e separazione, sono incredibili per il prezzo pagato.

Questo è un ottimo iem per chi vuole un ascolto rilassato, cablato, spendendo una cifra ridicola. Per chi cerca un ascolto critico non la consiglio solo per via dell'economicità del driver. Bassi ce ne sono, ma non è un auricolare per le teste di basso, la sua caratteristica principale è la chiarezza. Difetti: il gommini in dotazione sono parecchi ma sono di qualità mediocre, non si aggrappano bene e tendono un po' scivolare, di quel tanto che basta a cambiare il suono in peggio.

Die Kopfhörer haben ein für meinen Geschmack sehr ausgewogenes Klangbild und liefern eine konstant gute Leistung bis in Sphären, die ich von der Lautstärke her meinen Ohren nicht mehr zumuten möchte.Wer als Otto-Normalverbraucher guten Klang möchte baucht also absolut nicht tief in die Tasche zu greifen. Für die wahren audiophilen Zeitgenossen kann es natürlich immer etwas mehr sein :DIch denke ich werde mir bei Zeiten noch ein Reserve-Paar besorgen für alle Fälle. im Austausch für das mit den 7Hz x Crinacle Zero:2 mitgelieferten 3,5mm Klinkenkabel gekauft um endlich den symmetrischen Anschluss meines neuen gebrauchten Hiby R5 Gen2 nutzen zu können. Was soll ich sagen - klanglich liegen Welten zwischen der Audioleistung der Stereo-Klinke zum symmetrischen Anschluss. Das Kabel hat die Kopfhörer nochmals stark aufgewertet und ist somit jeden Cent wert. Optisch sieht es auch noch super aus und ist top verarbeitet und haptisch ein Erlebnis. Klare Kaufempfehlung daher von mir.    "

"565","TOZO T18 Bluetooth 5.3 True Wireless Stereo Earphones IPX8 Waterproof in Ear Headset Call Noise Reduction Headphones with Digital Display and Transparent Case Long Standby Earbuds Black  ","Christian Görgen","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the Netherlands on 29 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Background: I work with video, sound design, animation and 3D modelling. I use headphones rather than speakers (I have studio monitor speakers) to master the audio, music, sound effects and foley sounds in projects. I will listen to the mixdown both on headphones and then the studio monitors afterwardsMy Needs: Clear, Distortion-free, Full sounding headphones (with no artificial noise cancellation or artificially boosted frequencies) that capture the nuance of sound from the deep rumble of earth tremors to the whine of mechanical gears moving and still be able to throw on a playlist of drum & bass or chunky house music to groove to while creating landscapes, pre-vis concepts, modelling or sculpting.I read up on all sorts of headphones and IEMs, checked on reviews, consulted with friends with similar backgrounds, surprisingly, these IEMs came recommended by several connections and reviewers. I had a hard time believing that a pair of $40 in-ear monitors could compete with my Shure 535's (that died) and the Pioneer DJE-2000's that I used as a club dj.**Before I go into a review I will say that I purchased the Linsoul Tripowin 16-core IEM cable the same time I purchased these monitors and have not used the included 4-core standard cable. More on that later.**PROS:1. PRICE! Hands down this is the number one advantage to these IEMs. I don't need to expand on that too much, $37.99 CDN for this quality is ridiculous.2. SOUND: 10Hz-20KHz frequency range is also ridiculous. The added 3db of base from the previous model 7hz Zero does punch up the bass in music some but not to the point of creating crackling distortion or sound 'fake' when listening to spoken words vs music. For creators, the added depth (10Hz from usual 20Hz) of frequency and low end warmth created by the 3db boost is magnificent whether authoring music for an animation, creating layers of sound effects for atmosphere or mastering spoken words in video .. the sound is clean, neutral, and true to what you will hear in playback. (Unlike consumer brand bass heavy, augmented headphones).3. CLARITY: As above, very clean and true-to-life sound reproduction whether used on PC, Mac, smart phone or tablet. These just sound good, period. After a total of 20 hours of testing I found no discernible ear fatigue.4. COMFORT: I spend a lot of time in front of a computer with headphones on, comfort is #1 1/2 after sound quality. I opened the box, installed the cable and kept these in-ear for more than 4 hours without noticing any discomfort. I can easily see myself doing a straight 8 hours (or more) without issue. The units are light enough, fit the ear very well, are stable when turning from screen-to-screen and typing/drawing/mousing. 5-stars for comfort alone.5. Linsoul Tripowin 16-core replacement cable .. Truth be told, I haven't bothered to plug in the supplied 4-core cable that came with the Zero:2. I bought the replacement cable at the same time as the IEMs for a reason, more cores-more sound. If you read this and choose to buy the 7hz+Crinacle Zero:2 IEMs, buy this cable. Don't think, just add it to your cart and thank me later. Very well made, easy to install, and the sound ... well, core number counts for something, there's a reason CPUs are getting more cores and threads year-over-year.Now, CONS:1. STD CABLE: Supply the 16-core cable standard and add $10 to the retail price. People will still buy the replacements, but c'mon guys, give the drivers the love they deserve.1a. CABLE LENGTH: The Tripowin cable is 1.25m and the included cable is marginally shorter. These are fine lengths for hooking up to a remote transmission system for musicians ... when working on a PC or Mac desktop, well, it's a bit short if I'm being honest. Maybe this is splitting hairs, but, if there was a way to have a .85m main cable and include a 1m extension, that would be ideal for those of us tied to a desk rather than rippin' a phat guitar solo.2. NO FOAM EAR TIPS ?!?!? This kinda hurt a bit. I loathe silicon ear tips, always have and always will. Yes, Shure and Pioneer cost 5-10 times the price of the Zero:2, they also come standard with both silicon and Comply tips. I'm not saying Linsoul needs to include Comply, however, for me I know that heat sensitive foam tips create a better seal in-ear and therefore cancels out 95% of background noise allowing me to significantly lower the volume and saving my ear drums from the fatigue of daily sustained audio vibrations. PUT FOAM TIPS IN THE PACKAGE, charge an extra $5 if you must, your customers will thank you.3. NO CASE ... I mean really? This should just be a standard, not an upgrade. I can't think of a single reason a case is not an automatic addition to the purchase. Does anyone at Linsoul have a cat at home, include a case and save the rest of us from having to find kitty's new toy after we make a sandwich.Overall, I give these 4.8 Stars for the important things; SOUND, COMFORT, PRICE. Points were deducted for the important nice-to-haves; NO FOAM TIPS, 4-CORE STD CABLE, NO CASE. The Cons weren't enough for me to reduce the initial joy of listening to these IEMs for the first time BUT they are something the manufacturer should think about when/if the Zero:3 is being designed and packaged.Hope this helps some of the fence sitters and head scratchers.Peace, Love & Good Music .. also Happy New Year.

The sub-bass is deep and impressive, providing a rich, immersive listening experience. The highs are noteworthy, crisp and clear, making every note feel alive.As I spent more time with these in-ear monitors, I was continuously amazed by their moment-to-moment fidelity. The sound quality is so exceptional that it may set a new standard for your audio expectations. Indeed, once you've experienced the Zero 2, you may discover that only top-tier speaker systems are comparable in sound quality.What is truly astonishing is how these IEMs perform once you fine-tune them with some equalisation. They reach a level of performance that can only be described as world-class. When you feed these in-ear monitors well-recorded music, the experience is transformative, placing you at the very pinnacle of high-fidelity sound.The Zero 2 in-ear monitors offer excellent audio quality at this price point. If you're in the market for IEMs, make an intelligent choice with these. They provide outstanding performance at an affordable price of just £25.99, which is unparalleled.  "

I love how these sound nice bass pretty clear all through out. If i use on tablet in 3.5mm jack or c type to 3.5mm dongle on s22plus or on hidizs s9pro dacamp on my cell with amazon music app they sound awesome. Even on xbox controller watching flix or movies purchased. Pretty loud piercing highs when powerd with dac amp powering them or not same goes with bass but stays pretty clear on either of these 4 ways i use these zero 2. If these are lower sounding high notes compared to the og zeros? Im pretty interested in trying the og pair to see how they compare in future. Pretty inexpensive iem's but very good sounding. Red tips that came with iems were good and worked but i found that i love the comply tips 500 series fit size medium for my ear canals. Got new 0.78mm 2 pin 3.5mm cord for this as well. No need to do that though the 5 or 6 tips and cord that come provided with iems works perfectly fine. I'll prob buy a set of these for people down the road as well as gift for music lovers or movie watchers. No microphone built in if anyone is looking for that i believe the og zero by linsoul 7hz have a built in mic on cord. No distortion on full volume cranked up with dac amp i use amazon music app for my tunes. No need for dac amp to enjoy these, plug into any 3.5mm port and they sound great! Nothing broken or missing when I received & opened package.  Only thing you will probably need to buy or find is little baggy or hard case to carry around if want to use while out & about.  "

Other than that it's the same insane value, with a better plastic shell (i went with the turquoise colourway), better cable, and allegedly better driver. I couldn't tell you whether the driver is actually better, to me it sounds about the same sound clarity as the original, just with slightly more ""fullness"" from a better bass response.The only arguments against this for me are 1. You liked the relatively anemic bass response of the original (compared to rivals like the tangzu wa'ner) - i didn't mind it personally but I was also one of the people who did bump up the low freqs by a couple dB2. You already have the original and don't want to spend the money again on what is effectively only a slight upgrade. It's better imo, but not so much that I'd say you should run out and get them if youre already happy with your current 7hz zeros3. you tried the original and they didn't fit you. the shape is exactly the same here.

If you want a noticeable upgrade, you can get the Zero Reds from truth ear that crinnacle also tuned but they are double the price. To get an upgrade past that point you're looking in the 300$ range.I would say it gets 4/5 on sound quality because of how shouty and fatiguing they get, at least for me personally. Basically, sounds great on anything really bass/mid heavy but vocals, especially female or high treble male vocals can really hurt your ears after awhile and sound flat.Prefer the more natural tone of the Crinnacle Zero Reds from truth ear but I keep destroying those at work and these are a good alternative that idc if they get destroyed because they are 20 dollars.Some of you buying these might be just journeying into IEM world let me just tell you tips are everything. Getting a correct fit with a good seal completely changes how IEMS will sound. I would personally pair these with good aftermarket tips to get the most bang for your buck.

Per questo si sono diffusi prodotti dal costo esorbitante. Non fatevi ingannare dal prezzo: anche spendendo cifre modeste si possono acquistare oggetti di ottimo livello. La confezione di questi auricolari è spartana, anche il cavo è veramente basic. Tuttavia, come dimostrano le misurazioni di Amir su Audiosciencereview, la resa è veramente molto alta. La risposta in frequenza è vicina alla curva Harmann per l'ascolto in cuffia. La distorsione è bassissima su tutte le frequenze. Ciò significa che se si collegano a un Pc si  può attuare l'equalizzazione senza difficoltà ottenedo una restituzione ideale del messaggio sonoro. Infine l'elevata sensibilità implica che anche un dac-amplificatore di potenza modesta può ""pilotarli"" a dovere. In definitiva, se si utilizza il Pc come streamer e DSP - con programmi gratuiti come EQ Apo, basta considerare una spesa minima di alcune decine di euro per un Dac/amplificatore di buon livello per un ascolto veramente soddisfacente. Se non equalizza la risposta in frequenza l'ascolto è soddisfacente ma manca un po' di apertura in alto.    "

I have a million pairs of wired Apple earbuds that sound OK, but don't fit my ears at all without aftermarket silicone tips that constantly fall off and need to be replaced. I have some cheap JBLs that actually sound pretty decent but also have sort of giant tips that hurt my ears after a while. I think I have small, cone-shaped ear canals that spit out earbuds or something. The external part of my ear also seems to be too small to cradle most wireless earbuds so they are always loose.I'd like to thank GenZ for introducing me to IEMs, which I previously knew only as those things kpop idols wear on stage, and had no idea one could purchase for simply listening to music. These fit my ears perfectly with the smallest tips installed and they sound (to me) amazing. I am not an audiophile, and I am definitely not a sound engineer, but I am much, much happier with the sound quality of these than I have been with any wired earbuds I've tried, especially for $25. I could also easily go jogging with these on without worrying they'd fall out, even if they were not wired. I love that I can just pop one out of an ear and leave it hanging to hear someone talking to me without fumbling it trying to store it in a pocket like I do with wireless buds.Anyway, thanks to Marco Renna for writing the review that finally convinced me to buy these (Amazon won't let me like his review for some reason). I followed his advice and also ordered the 16-core cable upgrade in fashionable purple. I haven't tried the included cable so I can't comment on sound quality differences but I'll take his word for it.The only issues I have are that I would like to have a mic so that I could take calls on these and it would be great to be able to control the volume and start/stop music from the cable, but these are fairly minor tradeoffs for the sound quality and the fact that they fit my ears this well. I can see how some users with small ears might have issues, but not me.  "

It's a shade brighter than neutral. There can be the occasional sharp spike in the high-mids, but not bothersome.But it depends on the person's taste. If you like a warm/dark sounding IEM then these are probably not for you.The bass is tight and lean, it's not woofy or artificial. If you're a bass head then it's probably not going to be enough for you, but if you like ""accurate"" bass then you will like these. The rumble is there, but it takes more of a supportive role than a primary role.The soundstage is accurate. Not overly wide, not overly narrow. You get the punch in the middle while getting a good amount of width. The imaging is good, I can easily pick out where each instrument is coming from.The comfort okay, not bad, not great. I can't wear them for more than 1.5 hrs before I start to wanna take them off. But I've got stiff cartilage in my ears which makes them sensitive to pressure over time, so most ppl should be fine.They are more comfy than my previous Bluetooth IEMs though.I don't love the look of the cable but it's not a deal breaker. Seems to sound good.Build quality is great with the all metal shells. I have no fear of them breaking in my pocket.I'm surprised they are this cheap, they're really good. Don't get me wrong, they're not gonna wow you as much as some great headphones, but their Amazon rating should be higher than 4.4. I bought some Bluetooth earphones for around the same price a few years ago and these are twice as good. These are underrated.Easy to drive too. I have them playing through my phone.  "

A lot has been written about how these sound, I'd just reiterate that they're on the brighter side than I'm used to, but not at all tiring, there is a richness and clarity with technical detail and a tight and precise bass response that I enjoy.

I'm just a casual listener but after trying this one, I can definitely say these are really good. The IEMs itself feel premium with its metal coating. It feels heavy in hand and the sound places the vocals in front of the instruments. The bass is decent, not too bass heavy but it's there. It just sounds great with general music listening (pop) and content watching. Gaming wise I feel like it's better if you get another IEM as the soundstage is not too wide in my opinion, so intricate sounds like footsteps is harder to pinpoint the exact direction.

Dadurch, dass es keine krassen peaks oder dips gibt, ist er auch sehr einfach mit EQ zu verändern. In meinen Ohren sitzen die IEMs leider nicht sehr komfortabel, das wird aber wieder von der Person abhängen.  Was mir negativ am Klang aufgefallen ist, ist, dass er nicht sonderlich natürlich klingt und es sich manchmal so anhört, als würden die Instrumente nicht richtig zusammen funktionieren. Er klingt generell sehr trocken und weniger ""abgeschlossen"", was glaube ich mit der Geschwindigkeit des verwendeten Treibers zusammen hängt.  Die Stimme ist meistens nicht sonderlich fokussiert, sondern steht eher im ganzen Raum, wovon ich kein Fan bin.Damit sind wir beim Positiven: Der IEM ist enorm hochauflösend. So, wie ich es noch nie bei einem IEM gehört habe, inklusive vielen, die bis zu dem Zehnfachen kosten. Immer wenn ich mit anderen IEMs Künstler wie Bob Dylan oder Faber höre, habe ich das Gefühl die Textur auf der Stimme komme nicht richtig rüber, wenn man es mit einem HD600 vergleicht. Das ist natürlich nicht fair, und ich sage nicht, dass der ew200 ganz da ist, aber ich habe zumindest nie das Gefühl, dass ich etwas verpasse. Die Klarheit und Seperation der einzelnen Details ist auch wirklich enorm gut. Ich habe gestern eine Vorlesung mit dem HD600 geguckt und dann zu dem ew200 gewechselt und mir ist sofort ein ganz eindeutiger Hall im Raum aufgefallen, den ich vorher nicht gehört hatte. Der Bass ist ohne EQ sehr laut, ich habe ihn 7db runtergestellt, was theoretisch deutlich niedriger ist, als ich normalerweise höre, aber der ""punch"" ist so gut, dass mir das garnicht so vorkommt. Im vergleich zu etwas wie dem 7hz Timeless ist das wirklich Tag und Nacht. Da ist der Bass noch lauter, aber es gibt garkeinen richtigen impact. Sachen wie die Textur auf der Stimme kommen da auch so gut wie garnicht rüber. Generell ist Einzige, was der Timeless besser macht das aufgeräumt sein und die Kohärenz des Klangs. Könnte ich nur einen behalten, würde ich auf jeden Fall diesen nehmen. Wenn ihr von etwas, wie einem Truthear Hola kommt, ist die Auflösung eine komplett andere Welt, ich könnte mir sogar vorstellen, dass sie am Anfang überfordert.    "

The silicone tips that came with them are not for me. I ordered a variety pack of foam tips and the large ones were just the ticket. I struggled until that point getting a good seal, and was somewhat disappointed with the low end. Once the proper tips for me were put on, now the seal is tight and sounds perfect on the bottom end.If you like a nice clean open sound, with crystal clear mids and highs, with a generally solid bottom end, these are great.

I am overall pleased with this purchase.  Overall sonic presentation is smooth and balanced with just a little bass boost below ~80 Hz.  No serious ""holes"" in the sonic spectrum.  Others have complained about the treble performance, but I find it to be pleasing.  Present enough without becoming over-bearing.  I am a little treble sensitive though to be honest.  Too little is better than too much... and the way these present sounds above ~5k I find to be just about right.  As far as mid-range sounds like vocals and solo instrumentation goes there's just enough boost/energy there to keep things interesting and avoid sounding dull.Be forewarned, despite the low price these are detail revealing enough to reveal poor recordings, and dull sounding source circuits.  Basically a dull, lifeless, flat source or source material will sound exactly that way.  These monitors will not do anything to ""color things up"".  Conversely, well recorded material and a well chosen source will handily reward the listener with an experience well beyond the $55 price.I am very slightly leaning towards the included foam tips the most.  They just feel right for my ears, they seem to block more ambient noise too.  I only wish they included more.  The silicone tips are a little firm feeling in my ear canal, BUT I like how easy they are to insert.  I will probably go back and forth between the various medium size tips.  I haven't completely settled on one strong preference yet.These are just a little on the bulky side for my ears.  I can't comfortably lie/sleep on them.  So as night time ""sleep-cans"" these will be a pass.  I will stick with my cheap JBLs for listening to forest rain and ocean waves while sleeping at night.  "

That being said Reds are not 3 times worse that Starfields either, I can easily see someone who prefers bass more than a more balanced sound liking Reds more.Without doubt I can recommend Reds to anyone who are looking to buy an IEM, it's relatively cheap, but on par with 100-200 IEMs (or if you like more bass - probably even better in some cases).

Sound is crystal clear and well balanced, treble is crisp without sounding tinny, and the bass punches HARD for an IEM. For the first couple of days I almost questioned if the bass was too much, but I just wasn't used to it - now that I've had them for a couple weeks they sound just right to me. Included tips are very comfortable, but did start to itch after an hour or two - added on a pair of SpinFit CP145s and now I could wear them all day.Separable cord is a great idea and means I don't have to worry about a damaged cable ruining them - though I will say the included cord seems a little flimsy, though it clearly carries the sound just fine, with next to no cable noise from moving it. It does tangle easily, especially with the ""ear hooks"", but that's hard to avoid even with a high quality cable.  "

I wanted something ""more"" than my Chu II's and didn't want to spend over $100. I tried 10 different IEMs under this price point and these blow all of them away, and it's not close.The ones I tested included the KZ ZS10, SIMGOT EW200, TANGZU Wan'er, Yinyoo Melody, Sennheiser IE200, Shure SE215 PRO, BASN Bmaster and more. Some of these cost more, some less than these Truthear x Crinacle Reds and I genuinely couldn't tell the difference between them until I put in these ones.Sure, they have different tuning, different specs and shapes. However, these are all around far and above all of the competition. For $50 these are simply insane. The only other IEM I would remotely consider ""over"" these would be the Moondrop Aria, and those are $25 more, so IMO not worth it. They're just more comfortable to me, but not enough to justify paying that much more. Truthear Hexa's are also great, but they're $80 as well.These are my undisputed value/performance kings. The only gripe I have is they aren't SUPER comfortable, but they aren't uncomfortable either. There is room for improvement in that aspect, but for the punch these pack, I absolutely don't mind that they aren't 10/10 in EVERY category.  "

Pero luego de usarlos por un par de días comencé a notar tonos y colores más cálidos y definidos en las canciones que por años he escuchado. Importante, probar varias medidas de las siliconas para lograr el equilibrio entre quedar aislado del mundo y tener buen sonido. En cuanto a los bajos, me parecen lo justo. No hace falta reventarse los oídos para apreciar los tonos graves. Entiendo que son unos IEMs de entrada, pero quedé muy satisfecho.

The bass is also beautifully tuned. You get enough boominess to feel it without it bleeding into the mids or distorting. The mid range is clean, although female vocals do sound slightly recessed compared to male vocals, but this is a minor and insignificant gripe. Treble extension, once again, is remarkably good for a two DD and the overall resolution was great in that it was unexpected, but don't plan buy these if you prefer something more technical with lifeline separation. If you're not doing critical listening, this is a fun pair that isn't fatiguing in the slightest. They are a joy to listen to and have become one of my favorite pairs of IEMs.  "

The case was also fun to fidget with. I had issues with the noise cancelation, where it would always turn off or wasn't calibrated correctly everytime I put them in. The headphones would also lose signal every so often and go silent for a second.Ear 2 (black):I wanted to upgrade as I heard they fixed and upgraded a lot of the features.Noise cancelation: The noise cancelation now has a few more modes and keeps the setting you chose! A neat feature now is when you take one Ear bud out, it automatically switches the other ear bud to transparent mode until you put the other ear bud back in. These aren't quite as good as my Bose QC35 noise cancelation but do work quite well especially at the gym.Sound: After directly comparing these to the ear 1s, the sound on the ear 2 is noticeable better. The ear 2 also has a customizable EQ in the app. Music and audiobooks are clearer. These also don't have the issue of the first ear 1s where it would lose connection to my phone every once in a while.Ear buds: still fit great, comes with 3 bud sizes. They still look dope. The touch buttons have now been replaced with squeeze pressure sensors which remove accidental presses. They also play a satisfying feedback click noise.Case: still sleek, and fun to fidget with. Love the materials they used. Crispier edges. LolCost: The cost is reasonable, these aren't cheap but they won't blow the bank.Cons: here are a few of my only cons.- The noises when switching noise cancelation modes or connecting can be abrasively high-pitched/loud at times. (Wish we could adjust these)- Requires a lot of cleaning depending on how much ear wax you produce lol, especially for the case since you can see through it.  "

Se escuchan muy bien!!! Eso si he notado que con el iPhone 15 Pro Max la salida usando un DAC de Ugreen como que no tiene mucha potencia, se escuchan muy bien pero llevando el volumen a lo máximo, por lo contrario, con la salida del jack de una MacBook Pro 14"" e iMac M1, la potencia es muy alta, con un 80% de volumen es mas que suficiente. Supongo que esta diferencia es por el DAC. Por ello ya compré el DAC iFi GO Link esperemos la potencia mejore. Otra situación son las almohadillas de silicona para orejas estas son muy comodas pero para mis orejas se sienten pequeñas y eso que estoy usando las almohadillas granes (L) por ello es que compre unas talla XL, pero esto es muy particular. Recomiendo ampliamente los audífonos para escuchar música en todo su esplendor, por cierto los bajos no son tan potentes, pero OJO Bajos potentes NO significa que este mal, por el contrario hace que los medios y agudos se escuchen muy bien.

They're just so overwhelmingly competent. Great detail. Great balanced bass. an OUTSTANDING soundstage and instrument separation, excellent imaging, not too hard to drive. Energetic and musical without being unnatural or V shaped. pretty universal shape that's comfortable in probably everyone's ears. The cable is fantastic and light. They're easy enough to drive that you don't need any special equipment.They're just outrageously versatile. Every genre I throw at them they just gobble up. Gaming? the soundstage and imaging are outstanding. Movies and lectures? dialogue doesn't get buried. The EM6L are a bit more natural in the mids, but these throw down on accuracy. They're fun without losing focus on technical competence.If I had to pick some complaints, I'd point out that the QDC connector is not the best. I had one wiggle a HAIR loose in a few weeks of just throwing them in my backpack and it was causing the right IEM to short. Linsoul just told me to return it on amazon and the process was easy enough, and I would never argue a single QC issue is indicative of anything more than an anecdote. The replacement pair has been rock solid.They're also fingerprint magnets. Piano black was a stupid idea. You touch them every time you put them in or take them out.  And the nozzles have no flange, so a few different kinds of aftermarket tips may not stay put (coreir brass tips thusfar have been the only ones that wouldn't stay put, but no issues with anything else, and while there aren't enough, the factory tips are very comfortable and well matched to them)The treble CAN be a little hot for people ultra sensitive to it. I personally like a brighter headphone (grado fans unite) and wouldn't even consider them very bright at all. But if you are hyper sensitive to sharp treble, these might be a bit much, though again, I'd highly encourage trying them first.But good lord. These are the most versatile IEM's I've ever tried. Particularly that glorious soundstage. Might be the best, most balanced soundstage I've ever heard in an IEM. They have just enough balance between fun and grownup that they're a no-brainer. Get some EM6L's. Nothing under $250 is as complete of a package as these sound.  "

Also I find the cable loop a bit harsh on the back of my ears as I wear glasses but I will be buying some silicone ear loops to help with that too.

No real soundstage to speak of, but it's an IEM, so that's par for the course. If you want to use EQ for even more bass, slightly less mids, even more treble etc. - these things will handle it perfectly.Build quality seems to be about as good as you'd hope it would be, but don't go running with them or use them at the gym - buy some cheap wireless buds instead, you don't really need to use anything high fidelity like this while you're exercising anyway.

After I left the review, I reached out to the seller for any potential remedies. They said to try cleaning it with a q-tip dipped in isopropyl alcohol, but the right earbud still sounded tinny. Because the product is under warranty, they sent out a right earbud without any hassle. After replacing the right earbud, both channels now work flawlessly and they sound amazing. I have them connected to a Fosi Audio K5 Pro, and I've only tested them in games so far, so I'm not sure about their performance while listening to music.

Rich, warm, full-bodied, with well-extended but SMOOTH treble. They tick all my sound preference boxes.Though Simgot says they tuned it to match Harman 2019, I really feel they improved upon it here, notably for me the extra mid-bass and lower-mids. Harman 2019 lacks there, making the signature sound thin and hollow to me.Overall, VERY little I can fault in these IEMs.If I had to split hairs, it's that the bass, while good in quantity, feels a little fast to me, like it doesn't decay completely naturally. I suspect it has something to do with the smaller (8mm) DD they used compared to the 10mm DDs you see more often. But that's a nitpick at worst.Overall, these are an absolute steal. Dare I say these perform at least 2x their asking price, if not even more.Well done to Simgot. 2023's really been their year, and in my mind, EM6L proves it!  "

"788","Shure SE215 Pro Professional Sound Isolating Earphones (Clear)  ",NA,NA,"Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2023","4.3 out of 5 stars","        These don’t have the same sturdy metal build like the ea500 but they are still very well made. These are resin with metal plates and they really look nice. The included cable is also very nice but I did replace it with a balanced one. The silicone tips are also nice and you also get a handy carry case.The sound on these is cleaner than the ea500 and it also has a more relaxed treble which is nice for long listening. The ea500 does have a fuller sound because of its single DD but you can’t really beat the details from balanced armatures. The mids and treble on these is just clean and detailed. The bass is not bad but it’s a bit elevated which makes it a bit muddy.I use a qudelix 5K so I added a little EQ to the sound to make it better for me. I reduced the bass evenly and removed a 4k peak that I don’t particularly like and the sound is just super clean, the bass is now detailed and the treble is relaxed but sparkly. I basically got an ie200 EQ profile for these and imputed the info in qudelix, they sound so good tuned this way. The EQ is not totally different from the original just slightly different so they do still sound good by default.Overall these are very good, Simgot puts a lot of effort in their recent IEMs. I like the driver configuration and that these have nozzles for each driver to avoid distortion, the drivers are also said to be of higher quality. Simgot is honestly doing a very nice job with their gear.  "

"790","Shure SE215 Pro Professional Sound Isolating Earphones (Clear)  ",NA,NA,"Reviewed in the United States on 8 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        These things are probably the best you can get for gaming at $100 (with discounts and whatever). The imaging is fantastic, separation and depth are very good for the price bracket and tonality, though a bit overly bright at times, is mostly solid but that little bit of spiciness up top seems to help the imaging precision and placement so it might not be too bad to listen a tad lower volume (or on some warmish source gear if you can) than you're used to if it bothers you, but should still maintain most of the emphasis you need even at lower volumes. The fit is pretty decent overall and the isolation is pretty good too. Stock cable is pretty meh, but nothing terrible. These aren't the most natural sounding for music, but they are marketed as a gaming earbud and they do that very well. If you're looking in the $100 range for gaming audio, they're just an easy rec. Overall very solid for their purpose.  "

I have severe tinnitus and mild hearing loss, so the quality of a pair of headphones is pretty much lost on me.

They sit comfortably in the ear, and I've worn them for an hour or so without the slightest discomfort.Recommended.  "

The sound is as good as it gets. Detailed, rich, very clean, very clear, superb resolution and detail retrieval, great instrument separation. Nice, well-rounded balanced sound but at the same time you get quite a bit of punchy signature that lets you enjoy the music immensely while you listen. I could go on and on. Simgot is an exciting brand and they are only getting better. This set accentuates the high quality of their entire line of products. You can see the amazing packaging in my video and it goes well with the quality of the sound that comes out once you pop these into your ears. Love these! Very easy 5 star rating!  "

The cords were jumbled. And the extra earpieces were jammed into the outer box....Whatever, this set of earphones is phenomenal. I tried a sound test with Saint Saens's Organ Symphony and these things trashed my Jabra 85t Elites.The difference was between mud and spring water: these earbuds sounded so clear and precise I went back to see if I had messed up the Jabra's equalization somehow. Nope. And to think I loved my Jabras until about an hour ago. I liked them so much that when I lost my first pair of 85ts few months ago I bought a second pair.Not only is the sound so much better, but these have twice the volume as well--though with the better definition it doesn't sound painfully loud at higher volumes. The sound, though louder, is clearer--not a wall of sound but defined sound.I am blown away by the quality of the sound. Are there are any Bluetooth earbuds that could win a comparison test with these things?  "

I consider myself a connoisseur of cheap headphones. These are leaps and bounds ahead of most cheap sets. These are fairly neutral and balanced. They don't sound muffled or too bass heavy.  I tend to listen to classic rock, alt, indie, podcasts and audio books.  All in all, it's a pleasant listening experience.  I like the right-angle plug as I don't think it stresses my phone as much if I inadvertently pressure the jack. I do think they are just a tad bit quieter than some other inexpensive phones I've tried (meaning I run the volume a little higher to get the same sound).  "

Ma non è cosa che accade facilmente.L'unica parte a contatto con l'orecchio è il cappuccio in gomma, che dovrebbe ""incastrarsi"" nel condotto uditivo, rendendo l'ascolto meno influenzato dai rumori esterni. Il suono, in relazione all'economicità del prodotto (acquistati a circa sette €) è decisamente molto buono e pulito, oltre che profondo e fedele.Va preso atto che anche la minima differenza nella posizione dell'auricolare nell'orecchio cambia drasticamente la qualità percepita del suono.È evidentemente che non è cosa fattibile, ma tenendoli in posizione corretta con le mani è possibile arrivare a sentire un livello sonoro veramente eccellente.Il cavetto di 1,2 m li rende comodi (Da tener presente che l'ultima parte, dopo che si sdoppia, è in plastica flessibile ma leggermente più rigida della gomma, il che crea un leggero effetto di risonanza del rumore che arriva fino all'auricolare, se in quel tratto il cavetto viene urtato).Per dire...non c'è da pretendere di avere un suono cristallino se sono usati in attività come il footing: insomma, gli eventuali rumori (fino ad un certo punto) rimangono dietro alla musica.Meglio evitare di lasciarli suonare al massimo del volume in quanto i piccoli speakers si danneggiano, come constatato.Opinione più che positiva.

Der erste Eindruck ist überraschend gut, die Ladehülle ist ansehnlich und praktisch, kommt geladen an. Die Ohrstöpsel an sich haben eine angenehme und im Vergleich zu Soundcore Liberty Neo (die ich grundsätzlich liebe!) zart und sitzen in meinen doch eher kleinen Ohren sehr gut und angenehm (meine Liberty Neos stehen immerr ein ziemliches Stück drüber, das ist mit den L29 nicht der Fall, was für das Schlafen mit Stöpsel im Ohr einfach angenehmer ist). Der Klang hat mich durchwegs positiv überrascht. Ich kann keine besonderen Schwachpunkte nennen, für mich sowohl zum Musikhören als auch für Podcasts mehr als ausreichend (Bass ist ausreichend vorhanden und die Höhen sind ebenfalls angenehm im Ohr, bin sicher nicht die anspruchsloseste Hörerin).Nun bin ich auf den Langzeitest gespannt bzw. wie sich die Hörer in den kommenden Tagen mit intensiver Nutzung präsentieren.Habe in diversen Rezensionen teilweise Probleme mit dem Geräuschverlust eines Pods herausgefiltert. Andererseits auch sehe zufriedene Nutzerkommentare vernommen, vor allem punkto Umtausch bei Problemen. Es bleibt dahingehend spannend, die erste zufriedenstellende Inbetriebnahme motiviert mich aber, dieses Thema anzugehen.Die Suche nach bequemen Earpods zum Schlafen ist mir da einfach zu wichtig.Abgesehen davon kann man noch anmerken: Insgesamt 3 Größen am Silikonaufsätzen dabei und ein kurzes Kabel mit C-Stecker. Köpfe sind keine vorhanden, ist natürlich super zum Draufliegen und die Touchfunktion hat sehr gut reagiert und entsprechende Funktionen ausgeführt.    "

Mein Fazit: Preis-Leistung ist Top. Sie sind deutlich besser als ich erwartet habe.Ich nutze sie (wofür sie auch gedacht sind) zum einschlafen. Wer also Kopfhörer für den Alltag sucht und damit hauptsächlich Musik hören will, ist hier falsch. Aber dafür sind sie ja auch nicht gedacht. Bei allem gesprochenen ist der Klang nämlich sehr gut, nur bei Musik vermisst man gewisse Bass- und Tonlagen. Ich hatte noch nie Probleme beim Koppeln mit dem iPhone, iPad oder Mac. Wenn ich auf der Seite schlafe drücken sie schon ein wenig in den Ohren, allerdings habe ich auch sehr kleine Ohrmuscheln. Sonst sind sie sehr angenehm zu tragen. Geladen sind sie sehr schnell und auf der leisesten Lautstärke hält der Akku auch die versprochen vier Stunden. Je lauter man sie stellt, desto kürzer wird die Akkulaufzeit. In einem vollen Zug auf höchster Lautstärke halten sie nur 2 Stunden, aber bei solchen Situationen wären andere Kopfhörer eh besser. Falls die Kopfhörer Hops gehen, würde ich sie sofort wieder kaufen.    "

"954","Nothing Ear (2) Wireless Bluetooth Earphones White - ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) Headphones, Hi-Res Audio Certified, Dual Connection, Powerful 11.6 mm Driver  ","andrea","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Italy on 12 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Introduzione:Se state cercando un auricolare a filo in-ear con microfono e remote control, il Samsung EO-IA500 potrebbe essere una buona scelta. Si tratta di un prodotto di qualità, con un design elegante e un suono chiaro e potente. In questa recensione vi racconto la mia esperienza d’uso, le prestazioni, i pro e i contro di questo auricolare.Descrizione del Prodotto:Il Samsung EO-IA500 è un auricolare a filo in-ear, compatibile con la maggior parte dei dispositivi dotati di jack 3.5mm. Ha un cavo piatto e anti-groviglio, lungo circa 1.2 metri, con un microfono integrato e un remote control a tre tasti, che permette di regolare il volume, rispondere alle chiamate, avviare o mettere in pausa la musica e attivare l’assistente vocale. Le cuffie sono di colore nero, con un logo Samsung argentato sul retro. Le punte in silicone sono morbide e si adattano bene al canale auricolare, garantendo un buon isolamento acustico. Nella confezione sono incluse tre paia di punte di diverse dimensioni (S, M, L) e una custodia in tessuto per riporre l’auricolare.Unboxing:L’auricolare è arrivato in una scatola di cartone, con una finestra trasparente che mostra il prodotto. All’interno ho trovato l’auricolare, le punte di ricambio, la custodia e il manuale d’istruzioni. Il packaging è semplice ma curato, e l’auricolare è ben protetto da una plastica rigida. Ho apprezzato la presenza della custodia, che è utile per trasportare l’auricolare senza rovinarlo o aggrovigliarlo.Esperienza d’Uso:Ho usato l’auricolare per ascoltare musica, guardare video, fare chiamate e usare l’assistente vocale. L’auricolare è facile da collegare al dispositivo, basta inserire il jack 3.5mm nell’ingresso audio. Il cavo piatto è comodo e non si attorciglia facilmente. Il remote control è pratico e reattivo, e i tasti sono ben distinguibili al tatto. Il microfono è posizionato vicino alla bocca e trasmette bene la voce, senza rumori di fondo. Le cuffie sono leggere e confortevoli, e non mi hanno dato fastidio nemmeno dopo un uso prolungato. Le punte in silicone sono morbide e si adattano bene al canale auricolare, garantendo un buon isolamento acustico. Ho provato le diverse dimensioni di punte e ho trovato quella più adatta a me.Prestazioni:Il suono dell’auricolare è chiaro e potente, con una buona resa delle frequenze alte, medie e basse. Il volume è regolabile e sufficiente per coprire i rumori esterni. La qualità audio è buona sia per la musica che per i video e le chiamate. L’assistente vocale si attiva facilmente con una pressione prolungata del tasto centrale, e riconosce bene i comandi e le domande. L’auricolare non ha una batteria interna, quindi non ha bisogno di essere ricaricato, ma dipende dall’alimentazione del dispositivo a cui è collegato.Pro:- Design elegante e discreto- Cavo piatto e anti-groviglio- Microfono integrato e remote control a tre tasti- Cuffie morbide e confortevoli- Buon isolamento acustico- Suono chiaro e potente- Compatibile con l’assistente vocaleContro:- Non ha il Bluetooth, quindi richiede il jack 3.5mm- Non ha la cancellazione attiva del rumore, quindi potrebbe non essere adatto a ambienti molto rumorosi- Non ha un indicatore di livello del volume, quindi bisogna regolarlo dal dispositivoConclusioni:Il Samsung EO-IA500 è un auricolare a filo in-ear con microfono e remote control, che mi ha soddisfatto per il suo design, il suo comfort e il suo suono. Si tratta di un prodotto di qualità, che consiglio a chi cerca un auricolare semplice ma funzionale, compatibile con la maggior parte dei dispositivi dotati di jack 3.5mm. Se invece cercate un auricolare senza fili, con la cancellazione attiva del rumore e un indicatore di livello del volume, potreste valutare altre opzioni.Spero che questa recensione vi sia stata utileAndrea    "

Acquistati per sostituire i miei vecchi auricolari in-ear Samsung bianchi, il cui filo è ancora tenuto insieme al jack per mezzo di colla a caldo, ma dopo dieci anni di onorato servizio ed anche maltrattati, ci può anche stare! Per me, che sono un patito di audiofilia, dopo aver provato altri tipi di auricolari simili e di altre marche, devo dire che il suono di questi Samsung non è niente male e non ha nulla da invidiare ad auricolari ben più blasonati e con prezzi esageratamente maggiori. Insomma, stiamo parlando di auricolari, non di cuffie o diffusori hi-end! Questi auricolari possono essere comodamente indossati per ore senza alcun fastidio, data anche la loro leggerezza e forma, i toni alti non sono troppo squillanti da dar fastidio, i medi sono ben presenti nelle voci, ma non troppo, come in un citofono, i bassi sono abbastanza profondi e vibranti nel giusto, quando presenti, ma non esageratamente da far vibrare pericolosamente i timpani e la tridimensionalità del suono è piuttosto buona, molto più che accettabile. Certamente tutto dipende dalla qualità di registrazione della musica che si ascolta. Non possiamo pretendere bassi profondi in un brano in cui non sono presenti. Preciso che sono stato anche tecnico del suono e, solitamente, ascolto la musica con equalizzazione flat e senza artefatti, in purezza, per apprezzarne la qualità con cui è stata prodotta alla fonte ed è per questo che prediligo il filo al bluetooth. Acquistati a 6,45 euro, con consegna in un giorno, per me sono ottimi e funzionano alla grande. Posterò aggiornamenti in caso di malfunzionamenti del prodotto. Amazon impeccabile.    "

Plus, as they are foam in-ear plugs (very comfortable) there is no feedback to my microphone, and so my voice is clearer with no echo. Oh... they sound great too. Now, even though the cable is a generous length I do use an extension 3.5 mini to mini cable, so its easy for me to get back from my computer if I want.

Due to personal issues with fit, and other minor details, I'd alter my rating to *4.5*.I've grown to really like the sound from these. I'm happy to use them for casual mixing (with caveats) when I don't want to use headphones, and I'm impressed with the build and ruggedness. They make me want to listen to music for the fun of it, and that's something. The isolation is hilariously good if you get a good fit, almost as good as putting in foam earplugs, even though you don't stuff these into the ear canal.Sonically, even with a 5mm driver the sound is impressive, with good detail up top and with the low bass tending towards ""fun"" rather than accurate. Personally I like that for the price, it makes audio exciting, makes this more of an all-rounder. That bass doesn't muddy the low mids - it's just a bit of supplementation to support the rest of the sound. The high mids are good for music but a little too prominent for speech, leading sometimes to more sibilance than I'd like around 6kHz. But that's the only thing I'd want changing, sound-wise, and it doesn't actually bother me on music. If you don't like the bass here, it's pretty easy to EQ it down on most smartphones by about 2dB, without artefacts.Not at all a super wide soundstage like you get with a Campfire Audio earphones, but they would cost 20 times the price of this. I like the immediacy of this set. If I want soundstage, I'll go for listening with open-back headphones.Build is solid with plenty of accessories; good carry case, two cables (one with mic), plenty of silicone tips (inc. large and small triple flanges) and one set of foam earphones as well. That second cable with a mic is great in case one cable breaks (seems unlikely), and it doesn't affect the sound quality at all. However, the mic quality is poor, very muffled, so I'd save it for short calls when you're not in noisy environment. I keep that cable on purely for the play/pause button - or assistant if you wish. Cables are really nice and strong, but there's a fair bit of cable noise. Strangely though you get used to this, and there's an included clip which might help.Comfort-wise, they took a bit of getting used to. The cables are detachable - though they aid the noise isolation by creating the seal, so keep them attached for best isolation. The memory wire works with a metal wire encased with the cabling for about 8cm from the earphone. Because of this, the wire's profile is larger and slightly stretched, and can get in the way of larger glasses' stalks. It takes some days of getting used to but it's worth the experimentation. They also help to relieve stress on the earphone if they get yanked out accidentally, and when running, they do keep the earphones on the ear rather than falling to the ground.But the fit is still really incumbent on the main module fitting well, and with my small ears, I've found that even when walking, they come loose sooner than I want, regardless of tips used (maybe I should get some custom ones). If I put on a sprint, they'll be loose very quickly, and you lose all the bass if the fit is off. But that's just my ears, you might honestly find them perfect running partners. When I'm not moving around they stay in place well. Not headphone-well, but enough that it doesn't bother me.For sure though, they're not the best for side-sleepers listening at night. They're a fair bit larger than, say, Apple's old earphones, which for all their faults are probably my pick for that use case, with their very flat profile.A few misconceptions:1. These are noise isolating, but not noise cancelling. Don't expect the sudden eerie quiet you get from a Bose QuietComfort or Sony WH-1000 series when you turn those on. However, the isolation is so good that I have trouble understanding the person speaking next to me even indoors, especially with the Comply foam tips used. From reading tech reviews, these apparently isolate nearly as well as Shure earphones, which have the best isolation around. No reason to doubt this.2. These aren't for high-level mixing. Reference sound quality is never this inexpensive. They would work well for monitoring audio on location, because they isolate so well, and the bass boost will compensate for the bass frequencies from the environment which are impossible to isolate out. I've also used these on stage but I don't recommend that. The isolation is just too good you can't make out anything else properly. I ended up taking them off on that occasion.Overall then, for earphones with wires going over the ear, these are probably the best value around. I got the clear pair for £35. Expect a solid build and good sound quality, and be prepared to spend some time getting the right fit for your ears. If you want something better, you'll probably need to spend more. I've enjoyed having these beside my AKG K702, Bose QC25, SoundMAGIC E30, and Earpods. All very different, all useful. The M6 PRO 2nd are the best all-rounders of them all!  "

The volume is made up for by the addition of the pair of Comply earbuds, which are memory foam and do a great job of noise-cancellation.The wire in the cable to bend and form around your ear is perfect, and i'm a very big fan of that.The little carry case is also a great addition, but, potentially a little too big for an everyday carry case. It stores the extra cable, and other accesories, but for an everyday thing, without the need to take everything that comes with it with you, a smaller case would be a bit better.I use these for everything. And they get used for a good chunk of the day, every day. I use them while walking, running, in the gym, and I use them for under my motocycle helmet. They fit in my ear nicely, and stay where they are when taking off and putting on the helmet! They also do a great job of blocking out road noise, and giving good sound quality. (I only wear one earphone while riding my motorcyle and it it the one on the opposite side of the road.

Ero un po' scettica perché volevo delle cuffiette con un sonoro discreto e che fossero abbastanza isolanti. Sono rimasta estremamente soddisfatta.Le cuffiette sono solide, robuste. Il cavo si stacca dagli auricolari, dunque è sostituibile - ma sembra comunque di ottima fattura. Il che fa intendere che sono progettate per durare. Vedremo, ma sono ottimista :)Nella confezione, oltre ad una bella custodia, ci sono tanti tappetti di diverse misure, il che è stato un bene. Ho dovuto usare le più piccole per farle incastrare bene - se le cuffiette non si poggiano bene nelle orecchie potrebbero esserci problemi a sentire i bassi.Non sono audiofila, né appassionata di un genere in particolare, ed il fatto che siano molto bilanciate mi piace. Noto sicuramente una grossa differenza rispetto alle mie solite cuffiette da 5€. Il suono è caldo e profondo ed è un piacere ascoltare musica e suoni calibrati (ho trovato queste cuffiette proprio tra le consigliate dal creatore di mynoise, un sito che uso spesso per alleviare problemi di ansia e mal concentrazione). Ho anche riscontrato un'ottima esperienza attaccandole alla switch: nei giochi con un buon sonoro è un'esperienza d'immersione auditoria.Non sono cuffiette del tutto isolanti (non vogliono esserlo) ma con musica a volume basso riesco a non sentire nemmeno la TV nella stessa stanza a volume massimo. Insomma: per me sono più che sufficienti. Le ho scelte trasparenti per una pura questione estetica e ne sono molto contenta.Unica pecca: un po' scomode sulle lunghe durate. Sia perché sono in-ear sia perché può fare fastidio alle orecchie il modo in cui il cavo deve passare sopra. Ma per un paio d'ore d'ascolto vanno benissimo, e dopo un po' ci si fa l'abitudine.Immagino che professionisti, audiofili o amanti di generi specifici possano trovare cuffiette più costose e più adatte alle loro esigenze. Io dal canto mio mi ritengo molto soddisfatta!    "

La verdad es que no soy una persona que le prestara mucha atención a los in Ear. Aún así decidí invertir en unos audífonos  de gama media baja de entrada, nada muy costoso. Mi primera opción eran los Shure e215, pero tras ver un montón de reseñas en YT me encontré con estos M6 pro, las prestaciones eran muy parecidas. y pese a que sabia que el sonido era inferior, terminé por comprarlos por las prestaciones a bajo costo.En primer lugar debo decir que, por todos los accesorios que incluyen, ya es un muy buen trato. Dos cables, uno de ellos con control, seis pares de puntas de silicon y un par de gomas de espuma de memoria comply (que quería probar desde hace tiempo) más el adaptador a 6.3 mm y un case semi rígido. La construcción es de plástico, pero debo decir que se siente bastante sólida. Los cables se perciben de buena calidad con guardacables tanto en el Jack como en la separación de los extremos que van a los audífonos.Ahora bien el sonido. Las quejas de muchas personas respecto a los bajos están justificadas, aunque parte  de este ""problema"" tiene mucho que ver con escoger la punta de silicon correcta que embone de manera correcta a tu canal auditivo. Si la punta elegida te queda bien, notarás una mejora significativa en la calidad del audio y en el aislamiento del ruido exterior. Si aún así sientes que no tienes una buena respuesta en bajos no hay nada que no se pueda arreglar con un ajuste al equalizador, aunque los que gustan de bajos exagerados se sentirán timados. Para los que gusten de escuchar música a frecuencias planas, están bien.Para los fans de las specsDriver de 10 mmrespuesta de frecuencia 20Hz a 20KHzImpedancia 16 Omssensibilidad 100±3 dB (1mW at 1KHZ)largo del cable 1.3 mcertificación IPX5 de resistencia al agua (no te emociones, es solo resistencia al sudor)Pros.- Buen audio- Cables removibles- Muchos accesorios- El control sirve con Android y iOS- Cómodos y resistentes al sudor- El aislamiento es mejor que el de unos in ear comunes- Bastante económicos (50 USD)Contras- Construcción (son de plástico)- Necesitas tomarte tu tiempo para colocarlos correctamente- La mayoría de los usuarios requerirán ajustar los bajos a través del equalizadorPese a los puntos en contra, no encuentro motivo para bajarles una sola estrella. Estos M6 pro son una excelente opción para entrar al mundo de los in ear de calidad de gama de entrada a un muy bajo costo. Seguro me servirán hasta que pueda ir por una gama más alta.    "

At about 4 months in there was a sound imbalance on the left monitor. Their website has clear instructions for troubleshooting which helped me find the origin of the issue. Then upon contacting the service, they quickly offered to repair the faulty monitor. Once I explained to them that the shipping to send the monitor from DK to USA would be too high for me, they just took a simple step to verify my purchase and offered to send a replacement instead, at their cost, which has now arrived and works perfectly (:All in all, extremely helpful and polite!

When reading the reviews for these IEMs I was surprised that most people reviewing them were using them primarily as ear buds for their smart phones so I was hesitant to buy them use for live music performance. After doing more research on MEE, I thought that I would give them a try. I was looking into getting another set of custom molded IEMs but didn't feel like spending hundreds or thousands of dollars. The M6 Pros are fantastic! They give a nice representation of highs, mids and lows. They don't have a big bass boost or anything (which I didn't want) as I need to hear the clarity of the various frequencies coming from the other instruments and vocals on stage. The M6 Pros come with a ton of various different tips to customize your fit and sound preferences as well as 2 detachable cables, accessories and a great carrying case. They are very durable and if you ever need to replace a cable, you can do that without having to replace the actual ear monitors. When I first began using the M6 Pros the high end was a little harsh to my ears but as the drivers got burned in over about 4 hours of use, the highs tamed down and there is a nice EQ of highs, mids and lows. If you are looking for a quality set of IEMs for live performance and don't want to spend a ton of cash, definitely give the M6 Pros a try. I am super happy with them and would buy them again!

I wear them 6-7 hours a day at my desk for both work and gaming and then for another 1.5 hours at the gym.Inside the gym they do not move from ear and offer a solid grip and feel. The isolation is fantastic with no external bleed to upset anyone near by but also don't let any external noise in.Overall -These earphones offer quality and value for money.

My review is accurate, however it's nearly 2 years later now and they're still going!! And that's with some heavy use. I regularly use them under my motorcycle helmet as well as when I want to listen in bed (falling asleep many times). They've outlasted 'premium' in headphones costing 3x more. The better seal in your ears, the better they sound.So I've changed my 4 star to a 5!*Original review*They are just about worth what you pay for them.In a quiet area these are fine with a balanced sound.Adjust the bass or treble in a variety of music genres and they cope well.However, they are no where near what I'd class as monitor headphones. Monitors need to exactly match the input throughout the Hz range and these cannot do that. But for the money it was highly unlikely that'd be the case (unfortunately).They are not noise cancelling, no matter which set of earbuds you put in.I purchased these to fit under my motorcycle helmet which they do very well, however I also wanted some noise isolation to reduce the wind noise which they do not do at all.Unlike the other reviewer I do not have any issue with the comfort. In fact I've fallen asleep with these headphones in, a lot, and not awoke with painful ears on any occasion. I can even lie my head fully on one side and listen without discomfort so it got an extra star just for that.They come with an extra cable so I think that'll add to the overall durability.All in all not bad, but didn't do the job I bought them for.

I picked up a set of these on a recommendation from another professional bassist. Not because they are ""the best"" but because they are affordable, the sound is ""okay"", and they are very durable.After wearing these for a week tracking bass lines and performing in a small show, I'm very pleased with their performance. After following the instructions on their site on how to fit and set the IEMs, I didn't experience the lack of clarity in the bass or loss of the lower end as other have said. I normally use flat response headphones and monitors, so my expectations may be different than others.With that being said, I did order a 2 driver version because I want a dedicated driver for the lower frequencies. I don't think these are good enough if you do mixing and mastering in a studio with because you do lose some frequencies, but they are good enough for tracking and small shows.All-in-all, if you don't feel comfortable shelling out $400+ on a upper end IEM, these are a great alternative. The sound is good, the durability is great, the noise cancelling is okay, and I don't really think you can beat the price.  "

(I've only worn these for about 60hrs over the course of a week.)tl;dr version:... it's in the tagline. I have nothing negative to say about these IEMs. This is not a ""5-stars at this $50 price-point"" score; I'd still give it 5-stars if it cost twice as much. Adjustable comfort ""for days"" (or at least 12 hours in one go), blocks out the world, reproduces the sound completely and faithfully, and comes with a good number of accessories/options.Comfort:Probably the only pair of in-ear monitors I've comfortably worn for long hours without issues. The generous accessories pack includes a multitude of silicone tips (and also a ""first one's free"" pair of Comply branded foam inserts) so getting the right fitment in-ear is not an issue. When you couple that with the thin but soft memory wire to set it in place around your specific ear shape, there's no way anything else can come close to being this secure and comfortable.Motorcycle note: These monitors do not protrude from your ears so work well under a helmet. The memory wire also helps to keep intermittent tugs from pulling them out while at speed. If you route them behind your back the large-ish bit of plastic that encompasses the wire intersection Y-join can dig into your back under a back protector and will get uncomfortable on rides beyond an hour.Sound:Very responsive and detailed. Faithful reproduction of all frequencies. If I am to nitpick I would say that JB's impression is spot-on accurate; there is a bit of ""boom"" to the bass. Not a whole lot; you can dial it out if that is your preference. Do not expect these to crush your skull with bass. That is not what they are intended to do. Rather, if you want to hear the music as it was intended to be heard you can't go wrong with this product.Motorcycle note: The memory foam Comply tips do a great job of blocking out noise so you don't have to crank your music to hear over the wind, thus saving your hearing. Think of them as earplugs that also happen to produce beautiful music.Accessories (see photo):There is nothing missing from the set. The included hard-case is nicely sized for protection and portability. The usual assortment of silicone tips are included; small, medium, large in both single flange tips and isolating (2 and 3 flange/baffle design). A bag of medium sized Comply tips are also included (my preferred tips). Musicians will appreciate the included 1/8"" minijack to 1/4"" stereo jack converter but I haven't had a reason to use that yet. Also included is a second cable (yes, this thing is modular) that contains an inline mic for calls (or piece-of-mind back-up cable if you somehow damage the other). By default, the unit ships with the non-mic enabled cable attached but changing them out isn't hard if you go that route. Lastly, there is a functional clip that makes short work of slack management for wire routing purposes.Misc final note:MEE didn't splash a garish logo on these so there's always that bonus if you don't like being a walking billboard.

I use them primarily on stage with Aviom personal mixers and the balance is far better than both the M6 Sport earbuds and any budget in-ear monitor I've used. I easily forget I'm wearing earbuds and imagine the music is in the room with me.CONS: The mid-range can get muddled, but I've only experienced this when there is an overwhelming amount of mids already in the mix (worse since I am a pianist). For casual listening, using an acoustic EQ helped when listening to music with lots of guitars, for example, all in the same range. The EQ improved overall clarity, which was already phenomenal.The only other con is the size of the headphone jack. If you are purchasing these for use with a phone, you might consider an adapter to downsize the 3.5mm jack that is on the M6 PRO cable. The adapter is 6-7mm wide.  It will not fit with my phone case, so I simply use a lighting-3.5mm adapter if needed. This is a nit-picky inconvenience, but one that is worth noting if you don't already have an adapter.PROS: I am in love with the sound quality of these in-ear monitors for the price. It is neither bass nor treble-heavy. There is a great balance between them, with softer mids. Kick drums come through with some punch and depth, and the bass feels warm and deep. The treble on these IEMs is crystal clear, something that is super useful for picking out piano parts from a track.Cable quality feels good, the memory wire around the ear is sturdy, and the earbud housing is barely noticeable in the ear. My sister, who does not like over-ear earbuds, even commented that the cases felt like pillows in her ear.I don't know if the tip/housing angle is different, but these earbuds sealed in my ears much more quickly than the M6 Sports. If you have odd ear canals like me, I'd give these a try, and even consider the custom molds. I did not know MEE Audio offered the custom molds, and the M6 PRO's come with a 10% discount for a set.FINAL THOUGHTS: I was on the fence with these for a long time, and even have a pair of Shure IEMs. I still keep coming back to the sound of the M6 PROs. If you're on the fence, pull the trigger. You won't regret it. Also, consider the Bluetooth adapter if you're in it for casual listening. I left a review on that page as well. Happy Listening!  "

I've also used over ear cans  including the AKG240 and the classic Sony MDR-7506. For buds I'm comparing with 5 driver KZ-ZS10 Pro's, which are also good products, but are in my experience more fragile, and MUCH more prone to tangling. Frequency range of the M6 Pro is excellent and relatively flat for buds, which generally are extremely variable depending on how you place them in your external ear. But the best part is the warranty support. I don't know what happened, but the left bud suddenly got rather warm, then cut out completely. A brief exchange via MEE's warranty department resulted in 2-day shipping of a replacement bud, which is working great. That's hard to find these days. A+ for MEE and these M6 Pro monitors.  "

I ride motorcycles and the speakers that are placed inside of the helmet are pretty much designed to make one deaf.  Helmets are loud from wind noise and buffeting.

I saw a review for these and decided to give them a try.  They do not stick out of my ears very far and I can easily put my helmet on over them and the seal in my ears was good.  Now I can ride with my communicator volume set quite low and I will be able to hear for a very long time.  The company offers custom silicone ear tips for these.  They are a little pricey and I had to get impressions made of my ears, but they give a really precise fit that takes them to another level.

I own two pairs of studio monitoring over-ear headphones which I use for mixing and mastering music, as well as for listening to music without an enhanced sound.I get hot easily wearing over ear headphones, so I wanted in ear monitors that would still provide a neutral yet detailed listening experience, and these are just what I wanted!They sound very close to my over ear monitors. A nice flat sound signature that still provides a very high quality listening experience. Bass is not enhanced, mids are present; the treble is not as crisp as my over ear headphones, but it's definitely there, just seems to be a little softer, but not muffled or dull in the slightest and actually really pleasant to listen to. I can definitely use these for mixing and won't need to worry about any part of the sound being exaggerated.I am very happy with these. It also has a nice amount of bonus equipment. Six extra pairs of ear tips, shirt clips, which I never thought I would see again, a 1/4"" jack adapter!!! Perfect as I can use it with my audio interface where other earbuds won't work even with an adapter. It also has an extra cable with a microphone! The mic is cool, it picks up a fair bit of noise but nothing too awful, perfectly adequate for recording quick vocals; and it doesn't pick up a lot of sibilance, which is another plus.Only thing I don't like are the the memory wires that go behind your ears. They're pretty finicky to try and get right and to get the buds to sit properly in your ears. Once you get it just right, it's fine though, and more than worth dealing with for that wonderful sound!I highly recommend these for people who want a neutral audio profile for either mixing music or just casual listening without an enhanced sound.

I listened to music at a low volume and I couldn't hear my mom talking at a normal volume 2 meters away.Using the non-sound isolating plugs however makes it quite easy to hear what is happening around you, which is great if you are using these in places where you need to be vary of the sounds around you.The packaging itself is really solid, and it comes with a lot of items inside, which is a big plus!

Due to personal issues with fit, and other minor details, I'd alter my rating to *4.5*.I've grown to really like the sound from these. I'm happy to use them for casual mixing (with caveats) when I don't want to use headphones, and I'm impressed with the build and ruggedness. They make me want to listen to music for the fun of it, and that's something. The isolation is hilariously good if you get a good fit, almost as good as putting in foam earplugs, even though you don't stuff these into the ear canal.Sonically, even with a 5mm driver the sound is impressive, with good detail up top and with the low bass tending towards ""fun"" rather than accurate. Personally I like that for the price, it makes audio exciting, makes this more of an all-rounder. That bass doesn't muddy the low mids - it's just a bit of supplementation to support the rest of the sound. The high mids are good for music but a little too prominent for speech, leading sometimes to more sibilance than I'd like around 6kHz. But that's the only thing I'd want changing, sound-wise, and it doesn't actually bother me on music. If you don't like the bass here, it's pretty easy to EQ it down on most smartphones by about 2dB, without artefacts.Not at all a super wide soundstage like you get with a Campfire Audio earphones, but they would cost 20 times the price of this. I like the immediacy of this set. If I want soundstage, I'll go for listening with open-back headphones.Build is solid with plenty of accessories; good carry case, two cables (one with mic), plenty of silicone tips (inc. large and small triple flanges) and one set of foam earphones as well. That second cable with a mic is great in case one cable breaks (seems unlikely), and it doesn't affect the sound quality at all. However, the mic quality is poor, very muffled, so I'd save it for short calls when you're not in noisy environment. I keep that cable on purely for the play/pause button - or assistant if you wish. Cables are really nice and strong, but there's a fair bit of cable noise. Strangely though you get used to this, and there's an included clip which might help.Comfort-wise, they took a bit of getting used to. The cables are detachable - though they aid the noise isolation by creating the seal, so keep them attached for best isolation. The memory wire works with a metal wire encased with the cabling for about 8cm from the earphone. Because of this, the wire's profile is larger and slightly stretched, and can get in the way of larger glasses' stalks. It takes some days of getting used to but it's worth the experimentation. They also help to relieve stress on the earphone if they get yanked out accidentally, and when running, they do keep the earphones on the ear rather than falling to the ground.But the fit is still really incumbent on the main module fitting well, and with my small ears, I've found that even when walking, they come loose sooner than I want, regardless of tips used (maybe I should get some custom ones). If I put on a sprint, they'll be loose very quickly, and you lose all the bass if the fit is off. But that's just my ears, you might honestly find them perfect running partners. When I'm not moving around they stay in place well. Not headphone-well, but enough that it doesn't bother me.For sure though, they're not the best for side-sleepers listening at night. They're a fair bit larger than, say, Apple's old earphones, which for all their faults are probably my pick for that use case, with their very flat profile.A few misconceptions:1. These are noise isolating, but not noise cancelling. Don't expect the sudden eerie quiet you get from a Bose QuietComfort or Sony WH-1000 series when you turn those on. However, the isolation is so good that I have trouble understanding the person speaking next to me even indoors, especially with the Comply foam tips used. From reading tech reviews, these apparently isolate nearly as well as Shure earphones, which have the best isolation around. No reason to doubt this.2. These aren't for high-level mixing. Reference sound quality is never this inexpensive. They would work well for monitoring audio on location, because they isolate so well, and the bass boost will compensate for the bass frequencies from the environment which are impossible to isolate out. I've also used these on stage but I don't recommend that. The isolation is just too good you can't make out anything else properly. I ended up taking them off on that occasion.Overall then, for earphones with wires going over the ear, these are probably the best value around. I got the clear pair for £35. Expect a solid build and good sound quality, and be prepared to spend some time getting the right fit for your ears. If you want something better, you'll probably need to spend more. I've enjoyed having these beside my AKG K702, Bose QC25, SoundMAGIC E30, and Earpods. All very different, all useful. The M6 PRO 2nd are the best all-rounders of them all!  "

The volume is made up for by the addition of the pair of Comply earbuds, which are memory foam and do a great job of noise-cancellation.The wire in the cable to bend and form around your ear is perfect, and i'm a very big fan of that.The little carry case is also a great addition, but, potentially a little too big for an everyday carry case. It stores the extra cable, and other accesories, but for an everyday thing, without the need to take everything that comes with it with you, a smaller case would be a bit better.I use these for everything. And they get used for a good chunk of the day, every day. I use them while walking, running, in the gym, and I use them for under my motocycle helmet. They fit in my ear nicely, and stay where they are when taking off and putting on the helmet! They also do a great job of blocking out road noise, and giving good sound quality. (I only wear one earphone while riding my motorcyle and it it the one on the opposite side of the road. (in the UK that's my left ear, when i ride in Europe, my right ear))Overall, good quality, good durability and great value for money!  "

Ero un po' scettica perché volevo delle cuffiette con un sonoro discreto e che fossero abbastanza isolanti. Sono rimasta estremamente soddisfatta.Le cuffiette sono solide, robuste. Il cavo si stacca dagli auricolari, dunque è sostituibile - ma sembra comunque di ottima fattura. Il che fa intendere che sono progettate per durare. Vedremo, ma sono ottimista :)Nella confezione, oltre ad una bella custodia, ci sono tanti tappetti di diverse misure, il che è stato un bene. Ho dovuto usare le più piccole per farle incastrare bene - se le cuffiette non si poggiano bene nelle orecchie potrebbero esserci problemi a sentire i bassi.Non sono audiofila, né appassionata di un genere in particolare, ed il fatto che siano molto bilanciate mi piace. Noto sicuramente una grossa differenza rispetto alle mie solite cuffiette da 5€. Il suono è caldo e profondo ed è un piacere ascoltare musica e suoni calibrati (ho trovato queste cuffiette proprio tra le consigliate dal creatore di mynoise, un sito che uso spesso per alleviare problemi di ansia e mal concentrazione). Ho anche riscontrato un'ottima esperienza attaccandole alla switch: nei giochi con un buon sonoro è un'esperienza d'immersione auditoria.Non sono cuffiette del tutto isolanti (non vogliono esserlo) ma con musica a volume basso riesco a non sentire nemmeno la TV nella stessa stanza a volume massimo. Insomma: per me sono più che sufficienti. Le ho scelte trasparenti per una pura questione estetica e ne sono molto contenta.Unica pecca: un po' scomode sulle lunghe durate. Sia perché sono in-ear sia perché può fare fastidio alle orecchie il modo in cui il cavo deve passare sopra. Ma per un paio d'ore d'ascolto vanno benissimo, e dopo un po' ci si fa l'abitudine.Immagino che professionisti, audiofili o amanti di generi specifici possano trovare cuffiette più costose e più adatte alle loro esigenze. Io dal canto mio mi ritengo molto soddisfatta!    "

La verdad es que no soy una persona que le prestara mucha atención a los in Ear. Aún así decidí invertir en unos audífonos  de gama media baja de entrada, nada muy costoso. Mi primera opción eran los Shure e215, pero tras ver un montón de reseñas en YT me encontré con estos M6 pro, las prestaciones eran muy parecidas. y pese a que sabia que el sonido era inferior, terminé por comprarlos por las prestaciones a bajo costo.En primer lugar debo decir que, por todos los accesorios que incluyen, ya es un muy buen trato. Dos cables, uno de ellos con control, seis pares de puntas de silicon y un par de gomas de espuma de memoria comply (que quería probar desde hace tiempo) más el adaptador a 6.3 mm y un case semi rígido. La construcción es de plástico, pero debo decir que se siente bastante sólida. Los cables se perciben de buena calidad con guardacables tanto en el Jack como en la separación de los extremos que van a los audífonos.Ahora bien el sonido. Las quejas de muchas personas respecto a los bajos están justificadas, aunque parte  de este ""problema"" tiene mucho que ver con escoger la punta de silicon correcta que embone de manera correcta a tu canal auditivo. Si la punta elegida te queda bien, notarás una mejora significativa en la calidad del audio y en el aislamiento del ruido exterior. Si aún así sientes que no tienes una buena respuesta en bajos no hay nada que no se pueda arreglar con un ajuste al equalizador, aunque los que gustan de bajos exagerados se sentirán timados. Para los que gusten de escuchar música a frecuencias planas, están bien.Para los fans de las specsDriver de 10 mmrespuesta de frecuencia 20Hz a 20KHzImpedancia 16 Omssensibilidad 100±3 dB (1mW at 1KHZ)largo del cable 1.3 mcertificación IPX5 de resistencia al agua (no te emociones, es solo resistencia al sudor)Pros.- Buen audio- Cables removibles- Muchos accesorios- El control sirve con Android y iOS- Cómodos y resistentes al sudor- El aislamiento es mejor que el de unos in ear comunes- Bastante económicos (50 USD)Contras- Construcción (son de plástico)- Necesitas tomarte tu tiempo para colocarlos correctamente- La mayoría de los usuarios requerirán ajustar los bajos a través del equalizadorPese a los puntos en contra, no encuentro motivo para bajarles una sola estrella. Estos M6 pro son una excelente opción para entrar al mundo de los in ear de calidad de gama de entrada a un muy bajo costo. Seguro me servirán hasta que pueda ir por una gama más alta.    "

The audio quality is quite good for the price range and with the several tip options it is easy to find a comfortable one. Would be nice to have a play/pause button on the cord, at least the one with the microphone, but that's just for convenience.What really impressed me about MEE was their customer service. At about 4 months in there was a sound imbalance on the left monitor. Their website has clear instructions for troubleshooting which helped me find the origin of the issue. Then upon contacting the service, they quickly offered to repair the faulty monitor. Once I explained to them that the shipping to send the monitor from DK to USA would be too high for me, they just took a simple step to verify my purchase and offered to send a replacement instead, at their cost, which has now arrived and works perfectly (:All in all, extremely helpful and polite!

When reading the reviews for these IEMs I was surprised that most people reviewing them were using them primarily as ear buds for their smart phones so I was hesitant to buy them use for live music performance. After doing more research on MEE, I thought that I would give them a try. I was looking into getting another set of custom molded IEMs but didn't feel like spending hundreds or thousands of dollars. The M6 Pros are fantastic! They give a nice representation of highs, mids and lows. They don't have a big bass boost or anything (which I didn't want) as I need to hear the clarity of the various frequencies coming from the other instruments and vocals on stage. The M6 Pros come with a ton of various different tips to customize your fit and sound preferences as well as 2 detachable cables, accessories and a great carrying case. They are very durable and if you ever need to replace a cable, you can do that without having to replace the actual ear monitors. When I first began using the M6 Pros the high end was a little harsh to my ears but as the drivers got burned in over about 4 hours of use, the highs tamed down and there is a nice EQ of highs, mids and lows. If you are looking for a quality set of IEMs for live performance and don't want to spend a ton of cash, definitely give the M6 Pros a try. I am super happy with them and would buy them again! Thanks MEE for delivering professional quality IEMs at such a great price point!  "

Highly recommend the memory foam ear tips they come with as they offer the highest range of noise cancellation.Sound quality -Probably will be the main bulk of this review. These are fantastic IEMs. The quality is rich, the bass is pronounced and well rounded, not boomy or loud.Mids are pronounced and rich. They are a little peaky towards the higher mids and required pulling back, could have been just my pair but after the one small tweak they have been perfectTop end -I did have to round mine off for my personal preference but the top end and brilliance is incredible. They are so clear and crisp so if your ear is lacking in top end, these can certainly make up for it.Comfort-These are so Comfortable with little to no ear fatigue. I wear them 6-7 hours a day at my desk for both work and gaming and then for another 1.5 hours at the gym.Inside the gym they do not move from ear and offer a solid grip and feel. The isolation is fantastic with no external bleed to upset anyone near by but also don't let any external noise in.Overall -These earphones offer quality and value for money. They are a great starting point if you want to get into IEMs but also a brilliant point of quality for price. No one should hesitate buying these.  "

My review is accurate, however it's nearly 2 years later now and they're still going!! And that's with some heavy use. I regularly use them under my motorcycle helmet as well as when I want to listen in bed (falling asleep many times). They've outlasted 'premium' in headphones costing 3x more. The better seal in your ears, the better they sound.So I've changed my 4 star to a 5!*Original review*They are just about worth what you pay for them.In a quiet area these are fine with a balanced sound.Adjust the bass or treble in a variety of music genres and they cope well.However, they are no where near what I'd class as monitor headphones. Monitors need to exactly match the input throughout the Hz range and these cannot do that. But for the money it was highly unlikely that'd be the case (unfortunately).They are not noise cancelling, no matter which set of earbuds you put in.I purchased these to fit under my motorcycle helmet which they do very well, however I also wanted some noise isolation to reduce the wind noise which they do not do at all.Unlike the other reviewer I do not have any issue with the comfort. In fact I've fallen asleep with these headphones in, a lot, and not awoke with painful ears on any occasion. I can even lie my head fully on one side and listen without discomfort so it got an extra star just for that.They come with an extra cable so I think that'll add to the overall durability.All in all not bad, but didn't do the job I bought them for.

Not because they are ""the best"" but because they are affordable, the sound is ""okay"", and they are very durable.After wearing these for a week tracking bass lines and performing in a small show, I'm very pleased with their performance. After following the instructions on their site on how to fit and set the IEMs, I didn't experience the lack of clarity in the bass or loss of the lower end as other have said. I normally use flat response headphones and monitors, so my expectations may be different than others.With that being said, I did order a 2 driver version because I want a dedicated driver for the lower frequencies. I don't think these are good enough if you do mixing and mastering in a studio with because you do lose some frequencies, but they are good enough for tracking and small shows.All-in-all, if you don't feel comfortable shelling out $400+ on a upper end IEM, these are a great alternative.

The generous accessories pack includes a multitude of silicone tips (and also a ""first one's free"" pair of Comply branded foam inserts) so getting the right fitment in-ear is not an issue. When you couple that with the thin but soft memory wire to set it in place around your specific ear shape, there's no way anything else can come close to being this secure and comfortable.Motorcycle note: These monitors do not protrude from your ears so work well under a helmet. The memory wire also helps to keep intermittent tugs from pulling them out while at speed. If you route them behind your back the large-ish bit of plastic that encompasses the wire intersection Y-join can dig into your back under a back protector and will get uncomfortable on rides beyond an hour.Sound:Very responsive and detailed. Faithful reproduction of all frequencies. If I am to nitpick I would say that JB's impression is spot-on accurate; there is a bit of ""boom"" to the bass. Not a whole lot; you can dial it out if that is your preference. Do not expect these to crush your skull with bass. That is not what they are intended to do. Rather, if you want to hear the music as it was intended to be heard you can't go wrong with this product.Motorcycle note: The memory foam Comply tips do a great job of blocking out noise so you don't have to crank your music to hear over the wind, thus saving your hearing. Think of them as earplugs that also happen to produce beautiful music.Accessories (see photo):There is nothing missing from the set. The included hard-case is nicely sized for protection and portability. The usual assortment of silicone tips are included; small, medium, large in both single flange tips and isolating (2 and 3 flange/baffle design). A bag of medium sized Comply tips are also included (my preferred tips). Musicians will appreciate the included 1/8"" minijack to 1/4"" stereo jack converter but I haven't had a reason to use that yet. Also included is a second cable (yes, this thing is modular) that contains an inline mic for calls (or piece-of-mind back-up cable if you somehow damage the other). By default, the unit ships with the non-mic enabled cable attached but changing them out isn't hard if you go that route. Lastly, there is a functional clip that makes short work of slack management for wire routing purposes.Misc final note:MEE didn't splash a garish logo on these so there's always that bonus if you don't like being a walking billboard.

"1088","Nokia Wireless Earbuds, Bluetooth 5.3 Earphones in Ear with Dual ENC Noise Cancelling Mic,Touch Control Earbuds Deep Bass Stereo Sound, 20H Playtime Wireless Headphones, Black E3102Plus (Black)  ","Daniel Hur","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 19 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        OVERALL: These earbuds are incredible. I use them primarily on stage with Aviom personal mixers and the balance is far better than both the M6 Sport earbuds and any budget in-ear monitor I've used. I easily forget I'm wearing earbuds and imagine the music is in the room with me.CONS: The mid-range can get muddled, but I've only experienced this when there is an overwhelming amount of mids already in the mix (worse since I am a pianist). For casual listening, using an acoustic EQ helped when listening to music with lots of guitars, for example, all in the same range. The EQ improved overall clarity, which was already phenomenal.The only other con is the size of the headphone jack. If you are purchasing these for use with a phone, you might consider an adapter to downsize the 3.5mm jack that is on the M6 PRO cable. The adapter is 6-7mm wide.  It will not fit with my phone case, so I simply use a lighting-3.5mm adapter if needed. This is a nit-picky inconvenience, but one that is worth noting if you don't already have an adapter.PROS: I am in love with the sound quality of these in-ear monitors for the price. It is neither bass nor treble-heavy. There is a great balance between them, with softer mids. Kick drums come through with some punch and depth, and the bass feels warm and deep. The treble on these IEMs is crystal clear, something that is super useful for picking out piano parts from a track.Cable quality feels good, the memory wire around the ear is sturdy, and the earbud housing is barely noticeable in the ear. My sister, who does not like over-ear earbuds, even commented that the cases felt like pillows in her ear.I don't know if the tip/housing angle is different, but these earbuds sealed in my ears much more quickly than the M6 Sports. If you have odd ear canals like me, I'd give these a try, and even consider the custom molds. I did not know MEE Audio offered the custom molds, and the M6 PRO's come with a 10% discount for a set.FINAL THOUGHTS: I was on the fence with these for a long time, and even have a pair of Shure IEMs. I still keep coming back to the sound of the M6 PROs. If you're on the fence, pull the trigger. You won't regret it. Also, consider the Bluetooth adapter if you're in it for casual listening. I left a review on that page as well. Happy Listening!  "

I do both audio production and performance (as a musician/producer), and voice production (as a university lecturer). I've used these with Universal Audio apollo hardware (x4) and with Presonus 32R aux outs, as well as via DAC on multiple iOS and other computer hardware. I've also used over ear cans  including the AKG240 and the classic Sony MDR-7506. For buds I'm comparing with 5 driver KZ-ZS10 Pro's, which are also good products, but are in my experience more fragile, and MUCH more prone to tangling. Frequency range of the M6 Pro is excellent and relatively flat for buds, which generally are extremely variable depending on how you place them in your external ear. But the best part is the warranty support. I don't know what happened, but the left bud suddenly got rather warm, then cut out completely. A brief exchange via MEE's warranty department resulted in 2-day shipping of a replacement bud, which is working great. That's hard to find these days. A+ for MEE and these M6 Pro monitors.  "

I ride motorcycles and the speakers that are placed inside of the helmet are pretty much designed to make one deaf.  Helmets are loud from wind noise and buffeting.  The speakers just make it worse because they just add to the noise.  I started out with a very nice IEM, but they were nearly impossible to get my helmet on over.  I saw a review for these and decided to give them a try.  They do not stick out of my ears very far and I can easily put my helmet on over them and the seal in my ears was good.  Now I can ride with my communicator volume set quite low and I will be able to hear for a very long time.  The company offers custom silicone ear tips for these.  They are a little pricey and I had to get impressions made of my ears, but they give a really precise fit that takes them to another level.  Unfortunately, my motorcycling season pretty quickly ends once the time changes because it is dark when I get home.  They will be really nice next year.  "

I own two pairs of studio monitoring over-ear headphones which I use for mixing and mastering music, as well as for listening to music without an enhanced sound.I get hot easily wearing over ear headphones, so I wanted in ear monitors that would still provide a neutral yet detailed listening experience, and these are just what I wanted!They sound very close to my over ear monitors. A nice flat sound signature that still provides a very high quality listening experience. Bass is not enhanced, mids are present; the treble is not as crisp as my over ear headphones, but it's definitely there, just seems to be a little softer, but not muffled or dull in the slightest and actually really pleasant to listen to. I can definitely use these for mixing and won't need to worry about any part of the sound being exaggerated.I am very happy with these. It also has a nice amount of bonus equipment. Six extra pairs of ear tips, shirt clips, which I never thought I would see again, a 1/4"" jack adapter!!! Perfect as I can use it with my audio interface where other earbuds won't work even with an adapter. It also has an extra cable with a microphone! The mic is cool, it picks up a fair bit of noise but nothing too awful, perfectly adequate for recording quick vocals; and it doesn't pick up a lot of sibilance, which is another plus.Only thing I don't like are the the memory wires that go behind your ears. They're pretty finicky to try and get right and to get the buds to sit properly in your ears. Once you get it just right, it's fine though, and more than worth dealing with for that wonderful sound!I highly recommend these for people who want a neutral audio profile for either mixing music or just casual listening without an enhanced sound.

The IEM cord tucks discreetly behind my ear.I found a set of silicone tips that work well -6PAIR are included with the M6 Pro!  The bonus pair of premium foam tips are nice and comfy, too.  The foam will work best at isolating all outside sound -but it’s just not necessary with my application.  I don’t need all the other extras either - 1/4” adapter, cable with built-in mic, carrying case, etc, etc. All the extras really sweeten the deal!The cable is just long enough to go behind my back and plug into my mic sitting on a desk in front of me.I will NOT use these for my music pleasure.

I listened to music at a low volume and I couldn't hear my mom talking at a normal volume 2 meters away.Using the non-sound isolating plugs however makes it quite easy to hear what is happening around you, which is great if you are using these in places where you need to be vary of the sounds around you.The packaging itself is really solid, and it comes with a lot of items inside, which is a big plus!

I have nothing but praise for these monitors and the clarity of every instrument and every vocal makes it a great monitor to use.  I don't leave that many reviews, but this one certainly rated 5 stars in my book!!Update:  I have used these in ear monitors for several shows now as I play for a living.  I have used the SE112 Shure monitors before and these are every bit as good if not better than those!  I couldn't believe for the price that I would get a product that functions as good as the MEE6 2nd Gen ear monitors.  Every instrument is crystal clear and running the monitor system through an equalizer makes the experience that much better.  As of yet, I have not found one thing bad about these monitors and I often recommend them to other bands and musicians that I come across.I haven't had to use the customer service yet, but I am sure that they are every bit as dependable and reliable as the monitors are.  When I need to replace these, I'll upgrade to the MEE7's.

Der Sound ist warm und schön voll. Höhen und Bässe sind nicht betont, so wie es vielfach bei anderen Headsets gemacht wird. Heißt: Wer (einen neutralen) Klang priorisiert, dem sind diese Sennheiser sehr zu empfehlen - vor allem für einen Preis von rund 100 Euro (Stand Februar 2021).Die Touch-Bedienung funktioniert sehr gut. Im Gegensatz zu anderen InEars kann man damit auch einfach die Lautstärke regeln. Bei vielen anderen InEars kann man die Lautstärke meist nur eine Stufe rauf oder runter regeln, hier geht es bei längerem Druck auf eines der InEars stufenlos.Es gibt kein Grundrauschen, was bei Podcasts oder ruhigen Musikpassagen stören könnte.Die Videolatenz (am Android Telefon) ist zu vernachlässigen (für mich kaum wahrnehmbar).Es gibt dennoch Nachteile:Mich störte, dass man nicht beide InEars unabhängig voneinander nutzen kann (der linke funktioniert nicht ohne dass man den rechten verbindet).Der Sitz ist generell gut und angenehm, längere Telefonate funktionierten aber ""mit meinen Ohren"" nicht ohne dass die InEars durch die Bewegung rausgerutscht sind.Es gibt kein(e Angabe zu einem) IPX-Rating (Spritzwasserschutz o.ä.).Und ""Neutral"":Die Spieldauer (sprich Akkuleistung) lag bei ca. 66% Lautstärke auf einem Huawei Android Telefon ein klein wenig mehr als 5 Stunden.Die InEars schalten sich automatisch nach einer Weile ohne Tonübertragung ab.

"1103","Linsoul 7Hz Salnotes Zero HiFi 10mm Dynamic Driver in-Ear Earphone, IEM with Metal Composite Diaphragm, Stainless Steel Faceplate Detachable 2Pin OFC Cable (Black, Without Mic)  ","Michael Wexler","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 11 March 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Let's get the obvious out of the way: these buds are larger than you expect, and heavier, in part due to the 7mm driver (same as the more expensive Momentum line from Sennheiser)... but you won't care about the size or weight, because they just sound so, so incredible.That 7mm  driver does make amazing sound, better than any wireless earbud I've tried, and for around $100 at the time of my purchase, this has better ""quality sound / dollar"" than anything I've tried.But there are some odd design decisions.  The touch surface for the control on the outside of the big block is hypersensitive (even a quick touch from my hand can trigger a pause, much more sensitive than, say, Airpods Pro).  On the good side, you can control volume from these, but it's a bit tricky due to the sensitivity.  For all the audio quality, I found I had to set the volume higher with these than with other earbuds on both iPhone and Windows PC Bluetooth (in Windows,  go to Sound in the Control Panel (under ""Hardware and Sound""), highlight your headphones, click Properties, and select the Enhancements tab. Check ""Loudness Equalization"" and hit Apply to turn this on, helps a ton).  With the plugs in, your do get good isolation from the outside (so ""passive"" noise reduction), though of course, you now hear every breath and gurgle from inside your body, as you do with any sealed-ear device.  Even with a Bluetooth 5.0 connection (they support up to 5.1) on the PC, BT lag is still present; this is really evident watching videos and, to some extent, on video conferences.  The buds stick out from your head, and are heavy, so extended wearing became ear-canal sore, but never really painful.  The ear tips are silicone, but less flexible than from other vendors: I usually wear a medium in other earbuds, but it feels a touch large for my ears; the small felt too small.  I may invest in Comply Foam for the first time.The buds support SBC, AAC and aptX, which is nice for iOS or Android users.  Microphone quality is the usual: it's good enough, but not as good as Airpods Pro, and clearly not the primary focus of the buds.  It'll be ok, but expect to have to repeat sometimes, as with almost every wireless earbud out there.  Also, I missed the auto-shutoff from so many of the other modern earbuds; these just keep playing when you take them out (luckily, due to the hypersensitive touch panels, I accidentally pause when taking them out most times!).Also, an odd design choice means that the ""power pads"" where the buds connect to the terminals in the case is just rear of the earplug; this puts a ridged surface directly touching one of the folds of the ear.  If you push the earpiece all the way in, you are putting the one rough surface directly against your ear.  Sennheiser could have easily put this on, say, the rear-facing portion of the block and let smooth plastic touch the ear, but, well, they didn't.  You'll get used to it, but it's just an unnecessary design choice.Connection is quick with verbal feedback in the buds.  Battery life is as expected, and runs easily the 6 or so hours; the case can give another 12-13.  It takes longer than an Airpod Pro to recharge; it's worth charging over a longer break than just the few minutes other products can charge in.  The case has a USB-C plug, but the included cable is tiny; throw a normal length one in your cart when you buy this.  The case has no wireless charging ability, oh well.  The case is larger than expected, a little heavier than an Airpods Pro case, and due to it's rectangular shape and width, a bit pocket un-friendly.  The top does have a hinge-helper which holds the top open, something more cases should try.Sennheiser has an app for iOS and Android, and it really is necessary.  It allows a firmware update to 2.13.0 that substantially improved connection speed.  You can customize almost all the tap patterns; I added ""play pause"" to the right ear instead of just on the left.  It also lets you store different EQ profiles (just 3 bands, so a bit gross, but better than nothing; there's also a ""touch and slide"" interface but it's really just a layer on the 3 band).  The profiles are stored in the bud, and can be changed live via the app, even if you are listening to another source (so, using the phone to adjust the eq while listening to the computer).  The app lets you control the connections as well; like most BT devices, you can't connect to more than 1 source hot at a time (aka no multipoint), and switching is still manual (Apple's Airpods ecosystem is more automatic, and Bose has done a nice job of having 2 sources mounted at once and having easy swapping between them).These are not sport buds: they don't quite stay in all that well (in my ears) when moving and have 0 water/sweat protection beyond the usual (a bit will probably be fine, but during a heavy workout, these re not fully protected from salty sweat.)So, other than odd choices in where to put the power connectors, the large size of the main block, the sensitivity of the touch panel, and oddities of the eartips size, the sound quality is amazing, far better than I expected from a Bluetooth connection, esp. for the price.  Master and Dynamic has a similar pair that drop in price to around $100, and Yamaha has a nice pair around this price with similar specs, but after trying them all, I'm willing to put up with the odd design choices for that clean Sennheiser sound.

Los agudos son brillantes, los medios muy notables y los graves, créeme, no te decepcionarán, son super claros y profundos.No te los recomiendo para hacer deporte porque no tienen certificación contra agua.

Mostly it's the restrictions of the bud. It can only do so much being that small.I have tried Monster, Samsung, SoundPeats, Meze, Marshall, Anker, and even Klipsch.Among some of the cheaper brands too.So firstly, I have to say I have small ears. It makes it hard for me to family review some of them because they won't fit in my ears comfortably... A poor fit may skew the proper sound I would be getting if they fit...The sound quality is 5 star. Remembering, they are true wireless buds in the moderate price range.I am certainly not an audiophile in the truest sense but I do appreciate and expect the best of what it can do and Sennheiser hasn't disappointed.The sound is crisp, I hear all the hinted instruments in the background that you should in those certain tracks.  The bass is decent, not too overpowering.There is an app that you can adjust the EQ to your liking.Now for you small-eared people; you're going to need to get silicon replacement tips that have the little moulded ear clip thingy to get them to stay in. They come with the standard plug-type. For some of us, this just doesn't work.You just know I'll be standing over the kitchen sink when one decides to pop out.(They are rated for water, but you know...)If you can find the right tip for your ear, they'll be great.(Those Samsung Live Buds have the weirdest, most uncomfortable fit for my ears ever!)The price is right, the product presentation is nice, touch sensors are very sensitive and the battery lasts quite well, which is always relative to how loud you have them up. But for moderate use, quite good; 5-6 hours. Charging time is reasonable.I have not yet connected them to my phone so I cannot speak to the call answer, etc part of that, but I assume it works well. I bought them for music only.I am pleased, and would recommend them.  "

Even more so for earbuds at this price range. But hey, its Sennheiser.  Also, by using the Sennheiser Smart Control app, you can really make these sound how you want. From high bass, to low treble you can really change a lot. It also has the codecs for many different devices so it will sound great on Apple AND Android devices.Mic is decent and never had any problems with people understanding me even on windy high speed bike rides. Touch controls are great and responsive. Just try not to hit them when scratching your ears! One thing to not is that the right earbud MUST be out for use while the left one can be put back in the case.Build Quality:While the case could feel cheap at times as it just made from plastic, its clear to see that money went into the earbuds. They are very well built and fit great for me. While I don't have the largest ears, I found that the normal size worked the bets. They also come with Small, and large size caps. I also recommend twisting the earbuds inwards for a tighter feel. They have stood in during runs, windy bike rides, and vehicles.Battery:Batter is great. I think it gets about 20 hours with he case. You can check battery by pressing the little button on the back. green for high, yellow medium, and red for critical meaning you need to charge very soon. I think you can get about 4 charges with the case but I've had these for about a month now and I've only had to charge these things about 4 or 5 times and I use them for hours! Also. charger uses USB CProblems:While I think these earbuds are incredible, I do have some things I think they could add. Given the price range, I think earbuds like these should have some form of a transparency mode. While I think they have the hardware for it, the software does not support it. Honestly, This is the only area I'd say these things were ""lacking"". Active noise cancelation would be very nice too for the price but sadly, it is not included. It does have passive noise cancelling and honestly, I don't know the difference.Overall:Overall? Awesome product. These things sound nothing short of incredible and they fit and are built very well. They allow for great customization of buttons and EQ. About as easy to put on as any other earbuds. If you are looking for high quality earbuds, these are it.  "

Aunque no son baratos. estaba acostumbrado a los precios infalados y calidad diferente. No me gusta los controles pero es dificil adaptarlos a true wireless. El sonido es nitido y se puede sentir la musica. Lo unico es que si estas acostumbrado a escuchar muy fuerte (muy mal) como yo, al principio querras un poco mas de power. Pero no es necesario, una ves que te acostumbras aprecias el sonido de forma muy diferente a solo escuchar como retumban los bajos (por eso el volumen alto). Puedes usar el audifono derecho solo, pero no el izquierdo. Microfono decente, bateria buena con carga tipo C, case pequeño, audifonos algo grandes, pero una ves que logras entender como se acomodan no hay ninguna molestia.

I'm not expecting that level of quality from a set of $2-300 wireless units, but I don't put up with bad sound quality and I like relatively flat response.I've previously tried the Jabra 75t's and other, less expensive units, couldn't deal with the sound quality and dropouts.  I'm not a fan of hugely stilted EQ (the Jabras in particular had bass that was incredibly overpowering in a bad way).** The good **- Sound quality is great for a set of $200 earphones.  EQ adjustment was minimal to get them in the 'sweet spot' where I could hear everything.  Highs and transients could be a bit smoother, but everything is there and you can pull the things you want up/down vs just having to correct for massive problems.  Soundstage is impressive for something this small and (relatively) inexpensive.- Connectivity is miles better than I've had before.  I used to get dropouts riding my bike on other units (3 foot connection distance), and with these I can walk across the room and there's no issue.  Time will tell if this holds for other use cases, but so far so good!- Battery life is solid at 7 hours default, plus more with the case.  Longer than I'd ever have them in for in one setting, anyways.- USB C charger.  Love USB C and use it for most of my other devices, so this is handy.- The Android/iOS app is great and easy to use.  Relatively easy setting it up/getting it connected.** The not-as good **- Right ear only for solo stuff - doesn't bother me, and they explicitly tell you this in the instructions, but be aware of it if you're a left-ear only type person.- No ANC - I didn't want active noise cancellation, so up to you if you want it or not.  The ANC version the Sennheiser makes is $100 more, so up to you.- Slightly wonky firmware updates that take 45 minutes.  Hopefully won't have to do this often, so not a big deal to me.Overall, I'm very happy with these - I'd been waiting to see if they'd release a version cheaper than the Momentum Wireless 2's, and this has answered my request!  I'll update this review if anything goes haywire down the road, but so far these seem like a keeper.  "

Now you don't see the deal even on here or Sennheiser website. I think they don't even have it on stock.Well for the price, it does look big on my smaller ears. It stick out alot but I am used to it. Reason for the dimension, because the drive they put in for sound quality.For sound, this thing will blow most higher end or even like Jabra 75T out the water. Again go back to the thickness of their driver(sorry I don't know what it call), and you understand why. They invest alot into the sound quality.While we on sound, I can't be sure how the real performance for the noise cancellation. Once you get the volume high enough, everything all disappeared.Product overall, once downloading their app, you can customize how to program their touch display for either side. Which, other high end don't do.Con, to connect the the earpiece to your device, so far I manage to get the right only. I try doing the left earpiece but could never connect. Which I am fine with.Call quality can depend on your service, I have people on the other side can and could alot of background noise, sort of like white noise. Call is excellent, making calls with voice commands are perfect. So perfect I manage to send text messages on my son phone for a test and every words came out perfect.I give this a try, but looking at the price now, $199. Is this worth the price now, no. I would upgrade for the Momentum 2. For some reason the sound quality on this model is much much better. You get other feature that isn't on the model(which you can research yourself).Conclusion, best if you got on the $99 deal. Perfect for everyday need. Oh forgot, on some videos from browser, there is a small, very small lag between voice and video. Isn't bad still. I think the update fix it a bit so that made it not too noticeable.Buy it, but another $50 or so, you get yourself the Momentum 2 and you can seal the deal with sound quality and many other features that isn't on this model.

They were pricey at $300 and I never felt like the sound quality was that great.  After the warranty replacements also failed I decided it was time to move on and give something else a try.The sound quality of these is night and day better compared to the Bang and Olufsen.  I paid $100 on sale rather than the regular $200 price, but even at $200 these are a much better value.  I am getting double the battery life which gets me though an entire workday with a quick topoff from the case during my lunch.  I also love the fact that the range between the earbuds is good enough to use only the left and have the right sitting on my desk or in my pocket.  With the B&O the right earbud was also the master, but if I pulled it more than an inch or two away from my right ear the connection to the left earbud was lost.  My right ear faces my office door so the added flexibility is nice.The ability to customize the gestures is great too.  I like being able to tap either earbud once to play/pause when someone comes into my office.The only feature these are missing that I had before is a transparency mode.  The B&O implementation was so awful that I never used it.  I don't miss it.  "

The hinge of the lid is loose and feels like it might break if applied pressure. Other than that, excellent earbuds! I got them for $100 on sale, and for that price they are definitely worth it.

The firmware update was awkward, both in time to execute plus tying up the phone (couldn't use it to work out with another set of buds) At this point I was hoping the update would improve the sound quality, what I expect from this brand - and it did. Took a while, along with a break in period, perhaps 6-12 hours. After this period, these have proven to be much more detailed than expected.

Bass is sufficient but the mids and higher ends are crisp. Sennheiser even has an app where you can play around with an equalizer and personalize a sound profile or two to your liking. No active noise cancellation but if you insert the buds in enough they do a decent job of insulating from outside noise. Battery life in total (factoring in case recharging) is really good too.

The standard zeroes have excellent audio quality, great comfort, remain in-ear at all times (due to the quite comfortable over the ear hook), and were absurd value for the price.The Zero:2's are all of that still, but they somehow managed to improve the audio quality more.  It's not like the Zeroes are bad by any means, I mean I'm writing this as I have the originals on my head right now.  What I can say though is that you will not be disappointed if you purchase these either as a fresh purchase or upgrades from your existing set.And then there's the price.  I purchased these for roughly $20 USD.  Normally for that price in stores, you'll end up with a pair of earbuds that will stop working in six months.  I have been using the original Zeroes for a year now and have yet to have any hiccups at all with them.The one downside is the cord length.  It is well constructed and highly durable, but it is also on the shorter side.  I use my headphones to go from my desktop mounted workstation to my head.  It's not that far of a distance, maybe 2ft tops.  The length of the cord is roughly 3ft, so that's not bad for most users, and if you're just going from a laptop, handheld, or mobile it's going to be fine.  However if you do have a bit of a longer run, you may want to pick up a headphone extension cable along with this.  "

Ho deciso di comprare queste perché straconsigliate su molto forum audiofili, per poi continuare poi la mia ricerca di un prodotto di altro livello. Quasi mi hanno fatto passare la voglia di cercare iem più costosi. Non sono assolutamente gli auricolari più risoluti, o coi tecnicismi migliori, anzi, siamo sulla sufficienza, ma la loro musicalità, chiarezza e separazione, sono incredibili per il prezzo pagato. Suonano decisamente meglio delle mie Oppo Enco x pagate 4 volte di piu e anche meglio delle airpod 2. (Non credo possano suonare meglio delle pro). Questo è un ottimo iem per chi vuole un ascolto rilassato, cablato, spendendo una cifra ridicola. Per chi cerca un ascolto critico non la consiglio solo per via dell'economicità del driver. Bassi ce ne sono, ma non è un auricolare per le teste di basso, la sua caratteristica principale è la chiarezza. Difetti: il gommini in dotazione sono parecchi ma sono di qualità mediocre, non si aggrappano bene e tendono un po' scivolare, di quel tanto che basta a cambiare il suono in peggio. Questo anche per colpa del cavo che curva troppo presto e tende a tirare l""auricolare spostandolo un po' dalla sua posizione originale.

"1165","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ","Christian Görgen","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the Netherlands on 29 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Background: I work with video, sound design, animation and 3D modelling. I use headphones rather than speakers (I have studio monitor speakers) to master the audio, music, sound effects and foley sounds in projects. I will listen to the mixdown both on headphones and then the studio monitors afterwardsMy Needs: Clear, Distortion-free, Full sounding headphones (with no artificial noise cancellation or artificially boosted frequencies) that capture the nuance of sound from the deep rumble of earth tremors to the whine of mechanical gears moving and still be able to throw on a playlist of drum & bass or chunky house music to groove to while creating landscapes, pre-vis concepts, modelling or sculpting.I read up on all sorts of headphones and IEMs, checked on reviews, consulted with friends with similar backgrounds, surprisingly, these IEMs came recommended by several connections and reviewers. I had a hard time believing that a pair of $40 in-ear monitors could compete with my Shure 535's (that died) and the Pioneer DJE-2000's that I used as a club dj.**Before I go into a review I will say that I purchased the Linsoul Tripowin 16-core IEM cable the same time I purchased these monitors and have not used the included 4-core standard cable. More on that later.**PROS:1. PRICE! Hands down this is the number one advantage to these IEMs. I don't need to expand on that too much, $37.99 CDN for this quality is ridiculous.2. SOUND: 10Hz-20KHz frequency range is also ridiculous. The added 3db of base from the previous model 7hz Zero does punch up the bass in music some but not to the point of creating crackling distortion or sound 'fake' when listening to spoken words vs music. For creators, the added depth (10Hz from usual 20Hz) of frequency and low end warmth created by the 3db boost is magnificent whether authoring music for an animation, creating layers of sound effects for atmosphere or mastering spoken words in video .. the sound is clean, neutral, and true to what you will hear in playback. (Unlike consumer brand bass heavy, augmented headphones).3. CLARITY: As above, very clean and true-to-life sound reproduction whether used on PC, Mac, smart phone or tablet. These just sound good, period. After a total of 20 hours of testing I found no discernible ear fatigue.4. COMFORT: I spend a lot of time in front of a computer with headphones on, comfort is #1 1/2 after sound quality. I opened the box, installed the cable and kept these in-ear for more than 4 hours without noticing any discomfort. I can easily see myself doing a straight 8 hours (or more) without issue. The units are light enough, fit the ear very well, are stable when turning from screen-to-screen and typing/drawing/mousing. 5-stars for comfort alone.5. Linsoul Tripowin 16-core replacement cable .. Truth be told, I haven't bothered to plug in the supplied 4-core cable that came with the Zero:2. I bought the replacement cable at the same time as the IEMs for a reason, more cores-more sound. If you read this and choose to buy the 7hz+Crinacle Zero:2 IEMs, buy this cable. Don't think, just add it to your cart and thank me later. Very well made, easy to install, and the sound ... well, core number counts for something, there's a reason CPUs are getting more cores and threads year-over-year.Now, CONS:1. STD CABLE: Supply the 16-core cable standard and add $10 to the retail price. People will still buy the replacements, but c'mon guys, give the drivers the love they deserve.1a. CABLE LENGTH: The Tripowin cable is 1.25m and the included cable is marginally shorter. These are fine lengths for hooking up to a remote transmission system for musicians ... when working on a PC or Mac desktop, well, it's a bit short if I'm being honest. Maybe this is splitting hairs, but, if there was a way to have a .85m main cable and include a 1m extension, that would be ideal for those of us tied to a desk rather than rippin' a phat guitar solo.2. NO FOAM EAR TIPS ?!?!? This kinda hurt a bit. I loathe silicon ear tips, always have and always will. Yes, Shure and Pioneer cost 5-10 times the price of the Zero:2, they also come standard with both silicon and Comply tips. I'm not saying Linsoul needs to include Comply, however, for me I know that heat sensitive foam tips create a better seal in-ear and therefore cancels out 95% of background noise allowing me to significantly lower the volume and saving my ear drums from the fatigue of daily sustained audio vibrations. PUT FOAM TIPS IN THE PACKAGE, charge an extra $5 if you must, your customers will thank you.3. NO CASE ... I mean really? This should just be a standard, not an upgrade. I can't think of a single reason a case is not an automatic addition to the purchase. Does anyone at Linsoul have a cat at home, include a case and save the rest of us from having to find kitty's new toy after we make a sandwich.Overall, I give these 4.8 Stars for the important things; SOUND, COMFORT, PRICE. Points were deducted for the important nice-to-haves; NO FOAM TIPS, 4-CORE STD CABLE, NO CASE. The Cons weren't enough for me to reduce the initial joy of listening to these IEMs for the first time BUT they are something the manufacturer should think about when/if the Zero:3 is being designed and packaged.Hope this helps some of the fence sitters and head scratchers.Peace, Love & Good Music .. also Happy New Year.

I love how these sound nice bass pretty clear all through out. If i use on tablet in 3.5mm jack or c type to 3.5mm dongle on s22plus or on hidizs s9pro dacamp on my cell with amazon music app they sound awesome. Even on xbox controller watching flix or movies purchased. Pretty loud piercing highs when powerd with dac amp powering them or not same goes with bass but stays pretty clear on either of these 4 ways i use these zero 2. If these are lower sounding high notes compared to the og zeros? Im pretty interested in trying the og pair to see how they compare in future. Pretty inexpensive iem's but very good sounding. Red tips that came with iems were good and worked but i found that i love the comply tips 500 series fit size medium for my ear canals. Got new 0.78mm 2 pin 3.5mm cord for this as well. No need to do that though the 5 or 6 tips and cord that come provided with iems works perfectly fine. I'll prob buy a set of these for people down the road as well as gift for music lovers or movie watchers. No microphone built in if anyone is looking for that i believe the og zero by linsoul 7hz have a built in mic on cord. No distortion on full volume cranked up with dac amp i use amazon music app for my tunes. No need for dac amp to enjoy these, plug into any 3.5mm port and they sound great! Nothing broken or missing when I received & opened package.  Only thing you will probably need to buy or find is little baggy or hard case to carry around if want to use while out & about.  "

Very comfortable in the ear at least for me. The build quality is also very nice at this price, it is mostly made of a hard plastic, but the the stainless steel backplate is a very nice detail and makes these feel rather upscale in the hand.

Other than that it's the same insane value, with a better plastic shell (i went with the turquoise colourway), better cable, and allegedly better driver. I couldn't tell you whether the driver is actually better, to me it sounds about the same sound clarity as the original, just with slightly more ""fullness"" from a better bass response.The only arguments against this for me are 1. You liked the relatively anemic bass response of the original (compared to rivals like the tangzu wa'ner) - i didn't mind it personally but I was also one of the people who did bump up the low freqs by a couple dB2. You already have the original and don't want to spend the money again on what is effectively only a slight upgrade. It's better imo, but not so much that I'd say you should run out and get them if youre already happy with your current 7hz zeros3. you tried the original and they didn't fit you. the shape is exactly the same here.

If you want a noticeable upgrade, you can get the Zero Reds from truth ear that crinnacle also tuned but they are double the price. To get an upgrade past that point you're looking in the 300$ range.I would say it gets 4/5 on sound quality because of how shouty and fatiguing they get, at least for me personally. Basically, sounds great on anything really bass/mid heavy but vocals, especially female or high treble male vocals can really hurt your ears after awhile and sound flat.Prefer the more natural tone of the Crinnacle Zero Reds from truth ear but I keep destroying those at work and these are a good alternative that idc if they get destroyed because they are 20 dollars.Some of you buying these might be just journeying into IEM world let me just tell you tips are everything. Getting a correct fit with a good seal completely changes how IEMS will sound. I would personally pair these with good aftermarket tips to get the most bang for your buck. Personally have Render tips which are honestly more expensive than the IEMs and it massively enhancing the sound quality.  "

The manufacturer said they’d need twenty hours to break in. Done that and the bass on them when watching movies is phenomenal. They’re pretty flat in their response too.

Per questo si sono diffusi prodotti dal costo esorbitante. Non fatevi ingannare dal prezzo: anche spendendo cifre modeste si possono acquistare oggetti di ottimo livello. La confezione di questi auricolari è spartana, anche il cavo è veramente basic. Tuttavia, come dimostrano le misurazioni di Amir su Audiosciencereview, la resa è veramente molto alta. La risposta in frequenza è vicina alla curva Harmann per l'ascolto in cuffia. La distorsione è bassissima su tutte le frequenze. Ciò significa che se si collegano a un Pc si  può attuare l'equalizzazione senza difficoltà ottenedo una restituzione ideale del messaggio sonoro. Infine l'elevata sensibilità implica che anche un dac-amplificatore di potenza modesta può ""pilotarli"" a dovere. In definitiva, se si utilizza il Pc come streamer e DSP - con programmi gratuiti come EQ Apo, basta considerare una spesa minima di alcune decine di euro per un Dac/amplificatore di buon livello per un ascolto veramente soddisfacente. Se non equalizza la risposta in frequenza l'ascolto è soddisfacente ma manca un po' di apertura in alto.    "

I have a million pairs of wired Apple earbuds that sound OK, but don't fit my ears at all without aftermarket silicone tips that constantly fall off and need to be replaced. I have some cheap JBLs that actually sound pretty decent but also have sort of giant tips that hurt my ears after a while. I think I have small, cone-shaped ear canals that spit out earbuds or something. The external part of my ear also seems to be too small to cradle most wireless earbuds so they are always loose.I'd like to thank GenZ for introducing me to IEMs, which I previously knew only as those things kpop idols wear on stage, and had no idea one could purchase for simply listening to music. These fit my ears perfectly with the smallest tips installed and they sound (to me) amazing. I am not an audiophile, and I am definitely not a sound engineer, but I am much, much happier with the sound quality of these than I have been with any wired earbuds I've tried, especially for $25. I could also easily go jogging with these on without worrying they'd fall out, even if they were not wired. I love that I can just pop one out of an ear and leave it hanging to hear someone talking to me without fumbling it trying to store it in a pocket like I do with wireless buds.Anyway, thanks to Marco Renna for writing the review that finally convinced me to buy these (Amazon won't let me like his review for some reason). I followed his advice and also ordered the 16-core cable upgrade in fashionable purple. I haven't tried the included cable so I can't comment on sound quality differences but I'll take his word for it.The only issues I have are that I would like to have a mic so that I could take calls on these and it would be great to be able to control the volume and start/stop music from the cable, but these are fairly minor tradeoffs for the sound quality and the fact that they fit my ears this well. I can see how some users with small ears might have issues, but not me.  "

On les sent certes mais elles ne font pas mal, en tous cas moins que les autres que j'ai pu tester (Sony, Jabra, JBL, etc...)- La tenue dans l'oreille est excellente avec les petites ailes ajustables et permet de faire du sport sans craindre de les perdreEn bonus, elles améliorent encore le son de leurs devancières (les 2 Pro) qui était déjà excellent avec des basses profondes et percutantes, et des aigüs très bien définis et clairs. Elles font même redécouvrir certaines musiques avec l'apparitions de détails jusque là passés inaperçus...La réduction du bruit est enfin  vraiment active, réelle et efficace même si les différents tests trouvés sur le net indiquent qu'elles ne sont pas au niveau des meilleures (Sony XM4, Bose, etc...), ce n'est pas tout tout le sentiment que j'ai en les comparant aux Sony XM3 et à mes anciens Bose QC20 que je trouve tous deux un cran en dessous de ces SoundCore (cela vient peut-être du fait de leur très bon ajustement).Contrairement à beaucoup d'autres, elles ne sont pas trop intrusives et n'occasionne pas trop de sensation de bouchon dans les oreilles, ce qui permet de s'entendre parler aux autres ou au tél.Le mode transparent est un des plus efficace et naturel je trouve, avec une parfaite écoute de ce qui se passe dans l'environnement, une bonne spacialisation des sons, en mode vocal les voix ressortent bien et en a pas la sensation de suramplification avec du souffle ou autre.Le mode atténuation automatique du vent est également assez efficace et permet de ne pas être (trop) gêné et de pouvoir téléphoner dans de bonnes conditions.L'interface est très complète, tout est paramétrable et réglable en tous sens, des modes d'écoute, à la réduction du bruit, le mode transparent, l'égalisation, la diffusion de bruits (nature ou autre), la connexion multipoints, les commandes, etc...L'autonomie est bonne, la finition au top, l'étui pas trop gros et son design est sympa, il y a juste le positionnement des écouteur à l'intérieur qui n'est pas des plus aisé au départ mais on prend vite l'habitude de les mettre.Les commandes tactiles étaient pour moi un inconvénient rédhibitoire mais à l'usage celles-ci s'avèrent pratiques, simples, réactives et ne m'ont pour l'instant pas gênées, bien au contraire...Pour résumer, ces oreillettes ont tout bon, elles ne sont peut-être pas les meilleures dans chacun des domaines mais n'en sont vraiment pas loin et forment un tout très cohérent à un prix raisonnable (119€ en promo).

Maar het geluid gaat dan haperen of valt totaal weg.Verder eigenlijk niet zoveel op aan te merken, dit setje kan zich goed meten met enkele van de allerduurste.Want ook die bleken toch ook wel last te hebben van storing nadat ik op die afstand stond achter dat wandje.Ik ben van mening dat dit een BT probleem is, men belooft gouden bergen maar in de praktijk kan je rustig stellen als er obstructies komen hoe dun ook valt BT korter of langer weg.

"1229","Kuoadusl Wireless Earbuds 3, Wireless Bluetooth 5.2 Headphones 3D HiFi Stereo Headphones Noise Cancellation in-Ear Built-in Mic with Charging Case, Touch Control for Phone/Samsu/Xiaomi/Android/iOS  ","S. Faulkner","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 29 September 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","        First of all, I'm an audiophile and a technophile.I've spent 40 years in consumer electronics, so I'd consider myself as someone who is approaching expert level.Secondly, I've a headphone addiction. I don't want to add up what I've spent on headphones this year, or any year, for that matter.I own them all, value brands (under $50.00) mid-range $100-$200 and higher end, Sony, Bose, Sennheiser, etc.I particularly like headphones that punch above their weight class. In other words, these $150.00 headphones can compete with their Sony and Bose competitors that sell for almost twice as much money.I evaluate headphones using the following criteria:1. Ease of pairing.2. Fit and comfort. How long can I comfortably wear these headphones?3. Accessories. I like a good selection of different sized ear tips and wings to secure a good fit.4. Battery life and the size of the charging case.5. Packaging and unboxing. A company that gives me a good experience opening the packaging usually means a quality device.6. Device build. Does it feel cheap? Or, does it use quality materials?7. Sound quality (most important!) I evaluate sound quality on the following factors: Bass response. Is it clear and tight? Is it boomy and muddy? Midrange response. Good midrange means better vocal sound quality. Treble response. As males age, we lose our ability to hear higher frequencies or midrange. Good treble allows the listener to hear cymbals clearly.All right, let's go.Ease of pairing. You can do two things. The first time you use these headphones, they go into pairing mode. Using your device's Bluetooth settings, pair them up and they are ready to go. OR, download the Soundcore app from your respective app store and install it. Using the app, it will detect your Pro 3's and start the setup process. After a quick firmware update, I continued the setup. The app has a HearID procedure that tests your hearing, using different frequencies to see if you can hear them. It then tunes the headphones to your individual hearing abilities for each ear. You can also download an LDAC codec if you use a hi-res streaming service like Tidal, Qobuz or Amazon Music HD (I've got them all.) Apple Music finally supports lossless audio but if you're using an iOS device? It doesn't support lossless audio, even with their Airpod Pro model. Full disclosure: I don't like Apple products, other than my iPad for Facetime. Once you use the app and go through the setup? That's where these models shine. I was startled at how good they sounded.Fit and comfort: I've been wearing these headphones for almost 4 hours and I'm not noticing any significant discomfort. I suspect 6 hours will be my limit and I'll have to take them out of my ears for a break. As all of our ears are different? Your mileage may vary. Choosing the right tip and wing is vital.Accessories: It's an efficient setup with a good selection of tips and wings for most users. The charging case is smaller than the previous model which is nice.Battery life: I always recommend charging before 1st use. After 4 hours, I'm still at 65% battery remaining with ANC on. They claim up to 32 hours, with a full charge on the case. Depending on what level of ANC you use and listening volume, your mileage may vary. I suspect that their claims are pretty accurate.Packaging and unboxing: Efficiently excellent. They come in a 6"" by 6"" square box. It opens like a book, with quick start guide on inside left. The eartips and wings are in the ""spine"" of the packaging, followed by the headphones in their charging case and a USB C (nice!) charging cable.Device build: Excellent. I was impressed with copper color of the ""speakers"" (where you install the ear tips) I bought the black model. They have a nice matte finish with a grey/silver casing.Sound quality: (Finally!) Overall, they are excellent and they definitely punch above their weight class. The bass response is tight with the tiniest bit of boominess or muddy sound. I suspect a proper break in or changing the wings or eartips will solve reduce this. The midrange and vocals are impressive to excellent. Vocals are very clear and maybe a tad ""bright"". The treble is excellent. The highhat cymbal is damn near perfect. The stereo imaging and soundstage is EXCELLENT. You can place the instruments in the room. The depth of sound is excellent as well. You can hear the drummer behind the singer and guitar player to left and right. I used Tidal in Hi Res and used the headphones set up in LDAC mode.I use three songs to evaluate my headphones.Wicked As It Seems from Keith Richards excellent Main Offender album (2022 remaster) Keef records in analog and live in the studio. It keeps the ""air"" in the music and doesn't reduce the imaging quality.Barbie Dreams by Nicki Minaj. I really am not a fan of rap or modern R/B music. I just listen it to evaluate bass response. This track is where I noticed the slight ""boom"" in the bass. These tracks are basically made and mixed in a computer. No air in them. If you like this type of music, these headphones are satisfying.One by U2 (Mary Blige/U2 duet) This where the vocals and imaging shine. You can hear the subtlety in the Edge's guitar playing. The drums and bass are right where they need to be. You can hear the scratchiness in Bono's vocals and the sheer perfection of Mary's vocal range.I'll probably move on to some Fleetwood Mac, Phil Collins, and the Rolling Stones for further evaluation. I also like Adele and Imelda May. I expect I'll have the same experience as my 3 reference tracks.  After I do some more varied listening, I'll adjust my rating(s) if necessary.My review is really 4.5 stars. They are not quite a 5 but definitely deserve more than 4 stars.If you're eying Sony XM1004 or Bose Soundsport or Sennheiser equivalents but are struggling with spending $300+? Grab these Liberty 3 Pro headphones. Yes, the Sony and Sennheiser will sound better but not twice as good as these Pro models at half the price.If you're looking at dipping your toes in hi-res music and want a starting point? You can't go wrong with these Liberty 3 Pro headphones. I heartily recommend you use the Soundcore app and take the time to do the firmware updates and do the HearID to match these headphones to your ears and hearing abilities.If you've read this far? What are you waiting for? Get a pair or two....  "

Man kann Sie leider nicht einfach mal austesten. Hier ist man auf die Erfahrung anderer Nutzer angewiesen. Ich selbst bin ein großer Musikliebhaber, welcher sich bei sehr vielen Genres bedient und sich fast überall zu Hause fühlt. Das schwierige beim schreiben einer Rezension über Lautsprecher/ Kopfhörer ist ja leider seine eigenen Erwartungen und seinen Geschmack widerzuspiegeln, so dass der Leser dieser Rezession etwas für sich mitnehmen kann. Da jeder Nutzer in gewisser Hinsicht einzigartig ist. Ich/Wir können leider sehr viele Kopfhörer unser eigen nennen. Darunter befinden sich auch Modelle von Teufel, Apple und Bose. Die größte Enttäuschung war aber leider der deutsche Vertreter aus Berlin (Teufel). Der Klang war in Ordnung, mehr leider auch nicht. Fairerweise muss man auch sagen, es ist das älteste Modell und die Entwicklung schreitet stark voran. Nun liegen Sie leider als Ersatz im Schrank. Der Klang von Apple und Bose ist super, aber mir fehlen die tiefen Töne und das Musikerlebnis ist für mich nicht zufriedenstellend. Nun mal zu den Kopfhörern:Meine Frau hat sich das Modell (Liberty 3 Pro) vor ein paar Tagen gekauft und ist super zufrieden. Ich habe mir somit ebenfalls das gleiche Modell bestellt und bin der gleichen Meinung. Wir haben die Kopfhörer im Angebot gekauft (ca. 40% weniger als der normale Preis).Die Rezension ist der erste Eindruck nach einem Tag. Sollte mir noch was wichtiges auffallen, so werde ich es sicherlich nachtragen.Was finde ich gut an den Kopfhörern. Die vielen verschiedenen Aufsätze, Qualität und Sitz der Kopfhörer, der Klang und die Software (App). Die App ist wirklich wichtig. Ohne klingen die Kopfhörer wie so viele Kopfhörer. Der Equalizer und die vielen verschiedenen Voreinstellungen sind super. Ich denke, ziemlich jeder Nutzer findet etwas für sich. Man kann auch die voreingestellten Equalizer nach Lust und Laune anpassen.Trotz InEar „spürt“ man auch die tiefen Töne und runden das Gesamtpaket ab. Das Noise Cancelling oder der Transparentmodus ist erwähnenswert. Nur mit der App, kann man das volle Potential der Kopfhörer genießen.Das finde ich an den Kopfhörern nicht so gut. Das Noise Cancelling, wenn gerade keine Musik läuft. Man hat ein doch recht starkes Grundrauschen im Ohr. Das Ladecase fühlt sich nicht so hochwertig an, wie der Rest.    "

I managed to lose one after only having them for a few days. I think it could be because the case bowl not stay closed if you have a silicone cover on it and carry it using a carabiner. I ended up buying g a zipper case for these, which is perfect because it will also hold the charger cord.I love that the de ear buds come with so many sizes of ear pieces and ear wings to make them fit your specific ear. They’re the only buds I’ve ever had that reliably stay in my ears where they belong. The sounds is amazing, the app is amazing. I don’t like that they don’t always stay connected to my iPhone when I take a call though. If I switch to a different screen while taking a call, they often disconnected. It is super frustrating. I love that they always reliably connect to my iPhone when I first start to use them and they also reliably connect to my computer. I love that I can have my ear buds connected to my iPhone and work computer or work phone at the same time!! Now I can listen to music or podcast from my phone with ear buds (and excellent noise cancellation) and easily answer a call from my computer or work cell phone (depending on which I have connected). Absolute game changer.I wish there were more control options, but overall they are a bargain price for a reliable set of ear buds and they don’t break the bank if you happen to need to replace them.If you lose one though, you can’t connect it to a new device. You have to have both to be able to connect to a new device. Since I lost one ear bud on my original set, I am only able to use it on my work or personal iPhones, not my laptop anymore. Still happy to be able to have it as a back up though.Also, if you drop them back into their case for like 10 min, you get an extra 4 hours of charge! And the case stays charged for what seems like forever. I rarely ever have to charge the case.  "

"1240","Kuoadusl Wireless Earbuds 3, Wireless Bluetooth 5.2 Headphones 3D HiFi Stereo Headphones Noise Cancellation in-Ear Built-in Mic with Charging Case, Touch Control for Phone/Samsu/Xiaomi/Android/iOS  ",NA,"Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Singapore on 14 July 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Headphones and earphones are a very subjective piece of kit.What one person thinks is great, another may hate, simply because we all hear slightly differently.An example is the Bowers & Wilkins PX7 headphones.Loads of really positive reviews, yet I bought them and returned them within 24 hours because I thought they sounded awful!It was after returning those and wondering what I can get instead, that I came across these.Now, I have said it before, I am a big fan of Anker stuff. It is well made, well priced and their customer service is about the best I have experienced.So. at the point of writing this (October 2021) these have only just been released. This means I am a bit of a guinea pig, but also trying to write a balanced review for prospective buyers.NB. I purchased these myself so this review is going to be honest.I will also update once I have used them a little longer.The box they arrived in is quite striking and is aimed to have you feel you have purchased a premium product. It is solid and weighty. You know the contents will be safe.There is lots of stuff about them being endorsed by something like 20 Grammy award winning producers. You know, the sort of marketing hype that is so common nowadays.When I opened the box even this old cynic was impressed!On the left is a set of diagrams on how to get the best fit in your ear (more on that in a moment).In the middle are multiple sizes of the silicone buds that go in your ear, and the buds that sit on your outer ear.On the right are the ear buds (I think of them in old fashioned terms as In Ear Monitors - IEM's) and the carrying/charging case they will sit in when not in your ear.Clearly a lot of thought has gone into the presentation and it works.Now the guide on the left had me puzzled at first. I know how to put these things in I thought. Then I realised there are 2 parts to the way they sit in your ear.The problem with in ear monitors is keeping the damn things in your ear so they work to their best!Here they have designed them so the part that sits on the outer part of your ear has a silicone sleeve to help keep things in place. Then a second silicone sleeve is used for the bit that goes in your ear.They come in 3 sizes, small, medium and large for both bits.You could, in theory have small and medium in 1 ear and both medium in the other ear.In practice I found the medium size to work perfectly for me.They are comfortable with an excellent seal and I have not had them come loose in a few gym sessions since purchase.Also there has been no sweating issues or that feeling of pressure in my ears.So top marks for fit and seal.Now, before I get on to the sound, I have to talk about the app...The Soundcore app should be the benchmark for others to be measured against. It is that good!So many features, but you don't have to use them.If you wish, you can just pair them via bluetooth (simple and pretty much instant after the first time) and listen as you would normally.But, if you do go into the app - and I strongly recommend you do - you have a range of options.There are a multitude of EQ settings, options on noise cancelling and a couple of new ones on me.As things are new there will be regular updates. That is not to say they it is unstable at all. It has worked perfectly for me.HearID is where a range of frequencies are played to your ears at a very low level -  so you need to run this test in a very quiet environment - to identify how you hear.Once complete it creates a custom EQ setting for your hearing.It actually works too!There is also the same test run for getting the best out of the ANC (Active Noise Cancelling). In that one you want to be in a noisy environment - I used the gym.Now, how do these things sound then?Absolutely fantastic, to my ears anyway.Strong bass and really clear mids and highs. In short a wonderfully rounded sound that actually makes me smile!It will show up lower quality recordings, they simply won't sound as lively as a really good track.An example is Chocolate by Snow Patrol on Amazon Music. That sounds gorgeous with real depth and clarity.Switch to Street Spirit by Radiohead and it lacks the same level of depth - still sounds good though.The noise cancelling really surprised me. I put them into my ears at the gym and before I had even put any music on, the outside noise was almost turned off!It does not block out everything, but it was a huge difference.I still have a pair of Shure wired IEM's which were a lot more than these when I bought them a few years ago and I did a comparison.The Soundcore's just sound better!Now I have not tried these against the offerings from Sony and Bose but I would be amazed if they sound better.Gripes? Minor ones.Some foam tips would have been a nice touch. I love the Comply tips for a perfect seal in the ear.Placing the IEM's in the charging case can be a little fiddly at first. You have to get into the habit of putting them in a certain way which is counter-intuitive to me.And that is about it.For the price, they are astonishing and should be given serious consideration before you spend a lot more on the above choices!I will update again in a couple of weeks once they have had some more use.Update 08.11.21.So, a couple of weeks in now and I continue to be amazed at how good these are.I have used them extensively in the gym, out running and just walking around.They have not fallen out, or even felt like they were going to at any point.I fully charged them when I got them and the case still has 50% remaining with the earbuds at 100%.Battery life is not a concern.Did a firmware update last week and no problems at all.Never had a single connection issue in all the time I have been using them, which is probably in excess of 12 hours so far.2 friends tried these at the weekend and were blown away by the sound quality. One of them uses Sony's XM4 headphones and the other Airpods. Both are now waiting to see if these get reduced in the Black Friday sales later this month!Overall these are still hugely impressive and I really don't get the negative reviews citing poor connection/poor fit and especially sound quality!I should also add I am not using the very latest phone with them either. My personal phone is a Galaxy S9, something over 3 years old now.If these were not good, I would say it (my Bowers and Wilkin's PX7's review is an example!)These are probably the best earbuds you can buy when you take into account cost, battery life and sound quality.

Silicon gets softer over time, and I would regularly have to replace them as they age because they get loose and pull of the earbuds. With the clips, they remain securely attached so they won't fall off when removing the buds from your ear.- Carrying/charging case design is slim, low profile, unique and really stands out.- Wireless case charging is huge plus for me because I have wireless charging pads for my phone, and I don't like to constantly fiddle with plugging/unplugging cables just to charge devices I use daily.- Excellent Anker customer support.Cons:- ANC really quickly drains the battery. Fortunately the case has a large capacity and can quick charge the buds for continued listening enjoyment.- When using LDAC codec, music momentarily drops out at random times when paired to my Pixel 7. It may be related to bluetooth data transmission and/or buffer capacity or just connectivity. Not a huge concern, but nevertheless, it needs to be pointed out.If you're tired of all the mainstream brands, I strongly encourage you to give these a try. You will be pleasantly surprised and likely to become a convert!  "

However, my Galaxy buds pro kept falling out of my ears while talking and they caused ear pain if I wore them for over an hour.Bought these Soundcore L3Ps to replace the Galaxy buds pros. Wow, at the price of $130, the L3Ps provide amazing value! Since I have the L3Ps and the Galaxy buds pros, I am going to do a comparison review.Comfort/fit:The L3Ps win hands down. Galaxy buds pro causes ear pain for me, and they fall out if I talk. I tried yawning and the L3Ps stayed in securely.Sound quality:The L3Ps has a more interesting sound profile with more bass and more treble out of the box. The Galaxy buds pros sound more neutral. The L3Ps respond to EQ much better than the Galaxy buds. I EQed the L3Ps to be more neutral, and they sound less muddy compared to the Galaxy buds. Both had impressive sound quality as Bluetooth ear buds.ANC:Both provided satisfactory ANC. Galaxy ANC seems slightly better.Battery life:Don't know yet, haven't gotten a chance to run them out of juice.With ANC off, used for 45 mins and battery went from 100% to 90%.Connection:L3Ps have multipoint connection and I love it. Galaxy buds pro doesn't have it.I noticed my L3Ps dropped connection once or twice so far. Music stops for about half a second and immediately resumes. Happened twice in a few hours so far.For some reason, my Galaxy buds pro sounded better when connected to my Android phone, but slightly worse when connected to my Macbook Pro (and the Galaxy buds were not in headset mode.) The L3Ps sounded great regardless whether I play music from my phone or Macbook.LDAC:Turning on LDAC would cause the L3Ps to lose multipoint connections. I tried LDAC mode and the improvement in sound quality is noticeable but not big enough for me to give up on multipoint connections.HearID:I preferred a more neutral sound, but the HearID ear tests made the sound even less neutral. I would say I don't like it.(Update: after trying the HearID sound for a few hours, I must say that it sounded really good! It was a unique sound profile that takes some time to get used to. Now I am surprised how good the HearID sound profile is--the more I listened to it, the more I liked it.)Other factors:I like the Galaxy buds pro's talk detection, which turns on ambient mode and lowers music volume if I start speaking--e.g., super convenient for talking to cashiers at supermarkets. L3Ps don't have this feature.The ambient mode on the Galaxy buds pro is more customizable and feels better.I don't like the Soundcore logo--the logo looked like Beats knockoff?!Quality (or feel):Both have great build quality.The Galaxy charging case feels more premium to me and is also more compact.The L3Ps have a more premium packaging.Overall, I preferred the Galaxy charging case.For me the main deciding factors are:1. Fit.2. Multipoint connection.Update: 3. The HearID sound profile might be an ""acquired taste"", and now I enjoy it a lot.These earbuds for $130 are Amazing.  "

Jag hörde direkt skillnad efter jag hade gjort testet för personligt ljud.Ljudet är fylligt och djupt.Om man aktiverar touch kontrollen för en tapp så är det lätt att råka trycka av misstag.

Ich bekomme hier für kein Geld. Ich habe mir die Kopfhörer im April 2022 selber gekauft. Ist mir wurscht ob ihr die Kopfhörer kauft oder nicht. :-) - Selbstverständlich ist diese Rezension subjektiv.Und bevor ich mit meinen Lobhudeleien loslege, was stört mich an die Liberty Pro 3?1. Ich finde sie sind zu groß. Ich würde mir wünschen die Dinger wären etwas kleiner, gerade für das dauerhafte tragen wäre das gut (weniger Material = weniger Anstrengung fürs Ohr).2. Die Akkulaufzeit könnte noch einen Ticken besser sein. Grundsätzlich ist die schon in Ordnung insbesondere im Vergleich zu anderen Kopfhörern, aber ich würde mir so ca. 10 - 12 Stunden ohne Akkucase wünschen, dann würden sie meinen kompletten Arbeitstag mit Fahrtweg abedecken - Ein Traum.3. Die Ohrflügel halten nicht wirklich fest am Kopfhörer im Ohr passt es schon. Insgesamt sitzen die Kopfhörer bei mir gut (und das ist ja immer subjektiv), aber ein echtes Ärgernis ist, dass die Flügel verrutschen im Ohr und beim rausnehmen. Aus lauter Verzweifelung habe ich die Dinger nun festgeklebt (ich vermute mal Garantie - ade). War mir total egal - denn ich will das das sinnig sitzt.4. Das ANC könnte noch ne Schippe drauflegen. - Auch hier gilt, dass ANC ist echt okay. Aber noch ein bisschen besser wäre toll (jammern auf hohem Niveau).5. Der Transparenz-Modus ist Müll. Ist der an, kann ich trotzdem nicht alles verstehen, was gerade so läuft, also Gespräch mit Kopfhörern im Ohr mit Transparenz-Modus, kann ich bei meinen alten Ohren vergessen. (Ich habe auch die Samsung Buds Pro - da geht das).Nun zur Lobhudelei:1. Ist der Klang für meine Ohren 54 Jahre alt (also abgenutzte Ohren) wirklich klasse. Ich bin total beeindruckt. Ich fand die Dinger schon immer gut, habe aber heute Abend nochmals mit verschiedenen Songs getestet und ich bin wirklich beeindruckt. Das gilt für Pop, Rock und Classic. Schlager habe ich nicht getestet, da sind meine Ohren für inkompatibel.2. Bei mir passen die Dinger gut ins Ohr - wobei mich das ""eingedrehe"" etwas nervt, dass ist aber der Bauform geschuldet. Wie schon gesagt, die Ohrflügel könnten besser sitzen am Kopfhörer - im Ohr ist es in Ordnung. Insgesamt kann ich die Kopfhörer durchaus mehrere Stunden tragen.3. Die Verarbeitung ist sehr gut. Hier wurde wirklich hervorragende Arbeit geleistet, keine Spalten etc.4. Die App ist sehr gut (wenn sie auch ein klein weniger intuitiver sein könnte). Die Kopfhörer werden über Sensortasten bedient und das klappt wirklich ausgezeichnet - es lässt so ziemlich alles einstellen was man sich wünscht (bei mir insbesondere auch die Lautstärke). Ich konnte meine HearID ermitteln und damit hören sich tatsächlich die Kopfhörer am besten an. Wobei ich gerne auch zum 3D-Surround-Sound umschaltet - dann gibt es noch mehr räumliche Tiefe, das mag ich.5. Die Dinger unterstützen Multipointverbindungen, d.h. gleichzeitig mit 2 Geräten (bei mir Smartphone und PC) lassen sich die Kopfhörer verbinden. Ich höre z.B. Musik auf meinem PC und das Smartphone klingelt, dann wird automatisch umgeschaltet. Geil. Ich kann nicht verstehen, dass das nicht alle Bluetooth Kopfhörer können. Ein bisschen Salz in die Suppe gibt es trotzdem - LDAC und Multipoint geht nicht gleichzeitig - das scheint aber am Bluetooth-Protokoll zu liegen (kein Techniker).  Mir ist es egel - Multipoint hat für mich Priorität.6. Das Preisleistungsverhältnis ist für mich unschlagbar.Jetzt könnte der Eindruck entstehen, ich habe mehr zu meckern als zu loben. Dem ist nicht so, denn im Gesamtpaket (Multipoint, Geiler Klang, gute Passform, etc.) ist das ein Paket, dass mich persönlich sehr überzeugt und Happy macht.Was würde ich mir noch Wünschen? Das die Dinger eine Erkennung haben - wenn ich Spreche, dann in den Transparenz Modus wechseln und die Musik ausschalten. Und wenn ich nicht mehr in einem Gespräch bin, dann zurück zu ANC und die Musik wieder starten. Dabei ein Transparenz Modus der wirklich die Ausgeräusche aller Art gut durchleitet und gerne für alte Leute wie mich auch gerne verstärkt. Dann wäre mein Glück vollkommen.    "

Functionality was A1, and the included app means you can tweak the audio to your taste rather than adjust your phone's global settings which then has to be readjusted in the car etc. Fit was fine for me using the tips straight out of the box. For audiophiles, you simply cannot beat the sound from a closed back earphone/earbud.  "

Pairs immediately and very comfortable with excellent battery life. Easily fits the ears, sort of locking in place with a half twist. Great little carry case which offers additional recharging of 4-5 times the original. I only gave 4 stars for comfort because I don't like ANYTHING in my ears and for value because they are somewhat on the more expensive side. Having said that there are less impressive earpods for more money so I'm very happy with the purchase.  "

The noise cancelling is great too, even just for when your air con or boyfriend is too noisy in the background while you're trying to work. Worth every penny to me, glad I took the plunge. I use them multiple times a day. The literal only improvement would be pairing with multiple devices at the same time but that would just make them too perfect probably.  "

The pass though mode is brilliant if you want to talk to someone without removing the headphones.Battery life isn't a full 7 hours as advertised, maybe closer to 5 hours. but with the charging case you can go for quite some time. The bluetooth range is great,  can leave my phone on the desk and walk all over the house without dropouts.I'm not a huge audiophile, but the sound is pretty good whether being used for podcasts, music or phone calls.At the discounted price I'm very happy with the purchase, I would probably rate these more harshly if I paid full price, but all in all, these are a solid set of earphones.

I just wanted them for use at work to listen to music while plodding on. But I've found them great for several uses. They are now always used when driving motorbike, easy to slip helmet on/off over them, and the adaptive volume is incredible - obviously being sat on the engine the sound is vastly different, when I'm going 70 the volume shoots up, when sat in traffic the volume drops too. They'll never replace my Sony wh-1000xm4 for use on trains or at home, but they are more than adequate for any situation where big cans aren't appropriate  "

It’s affordable, but the quality of it never lets me down. The sound quality is great and they feel comfortable in my ears. And durable too! I dropped them so many times but they still worked no matter what. Sadly, I lost the case recently and had to use my warranty, but the customer support was amazing! They helped me through every step of the way and got me a new product. I’m really thankful for them. The only complaints I have its that the battery doesn’t last too long, but if you charge them for a few minutes they’re good to go again. And the protection screens inside the earbuds fell off, but I believe that’s my fault for bad management. They worked just fine though, I just needed to be careful not to get water in there.TLDR: Great product for music and gaming, great customer support. Will be buying from them again soon, I definitely recommend. 10/10(P.S.: The pictures are of my new earbuds, the last one is of my year old one that I lost the case of. They still work though, so I use them sometimes!)  "

Once again thanks to the great customer service at black shark.Only had it for less than 2 months and it worked great the volume adjustment needs some work but the bass was good too until the volume in the right bud suddenly went down.

(Ils n'auraient vraiment pas à rougir devant des écouteurs plus haut de gamme )Les écouteurs sont également tes beaux et très confortable et ce malgré le fait que mes oreilles aient une forme particulière qui me pose habituellement quelques soucis avec les écouteurs. Une fois fixé à l'oreille, ils tiennent en place et isole bien du bruit une fois la musique lancée.Pour ce qui est de la durabilité,  je devrais attendre de les avoir utilisé plus pour juger mais le fait que l'on puisse racheter un autre câble de remplacement permet d'apporter une certaine durabilité en replacent juste cette partie à moindre prix.Je suis pour le moment vraiment content de mon achat.

The build quality is impressive for the price as well. Lows could have been a bit more prominated, and the highs can be a little too penetrating. But don't allow those minor inconveniences to disway you from purchasing one. A great budget friendly IEM to step you into the world of how music should really sound.  "

"1571","Sony In-Ear Lightweight Headphones, White  ","SAM","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in India on 22 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Für das InEar Monitoring unser Gemeindeband gekauft, die Mitten sind wie bereits mehrfach erwähnt schon unterversorgt, Sound ist insgesamt ok, für den Preis aber unschlagbar. Einziges ""Manko"" war, dass es nicht diesen Zug am Nacken gibt womit man beide Kabel hinter den Ohren am Nacken besser festigen kann. Ist oft nur ein kleines durchsichtiges Röhrchen, macht aber extrem viel aus was die Tragbarkeit angeht.Eine Sängerin mit sehr kleinen Ohren hatte allerdings Probleme mit diesem Modell und ist auf ein anderes Fabrikat gewechselt. Der Rest (8 Personen) kam gut damit klar. Man sollte sie halt keine 2 Stunden durchgehend drin lassen, da wirds dann schon unangenehm. Das trifft aber auf alle IEMs zu, die nicht custom molded sind.    "

Sound very good, too.They arrive well-packaged in a neat little white box.  Look well-constructed.  For twenty-one smackeroos, you get great value with these.  I'm considering ordering another pair while I know I still can.  I've been listening via them for four hours - no pain.

It comes with 4 earbuds to adjust to ear sizes. It cables coming from the drivers do contour behind to your ears. I had to add velcro loop so I can cinch it closer to my head. The only thing that I would say is that I does stick out a bit for not being custom. So for the price & sound quality it’s awesome. I only have been using it for a few days. What I have researched is that the drivers will adjust after a few usage. I usually use in ear buds & the volume level is about 60% on my laptop. Now with this KZ ZSN volume level is 40% clean & Crisp.  "

I was previously using regular Bluetooth wireless ear phones, which are OK for practicing to a click or a playback through my phone, but don't have a way to connect to recording equipment.These sound great & with the addition of foam ear tips, block out external sounds to isolate the music coming through the in-ear monitors. I use these all the time when I practice to a playback. I also use them with DAW software to do simple audio editing at times of day when listening through speakers is impractical. I definitely recommend these as a good value, especially at this price.***Edit***I bought a second pair, I like them so much.  "

It sounds so much better and realistic.The sound on these is stellar. I was half expecting an extremely v-shaped tuning going into these, but knowing that these only equip a 6mm driver I had a slight feeling that they would actually have a more neutral default tuning. It seems as though my feelings were right- for the most part. The default tuning doesn't have much lower-mids and therefore sounds somewhat hollow, but with some tuning that can be fixed. Using the app I have bumped the 160hz slider halfway up along the band, the 400hz slider halfway up between the 160hz slider and the top of the band, the 1khz slider a couple notches lower than the 400hz slider, the 2.5khz a couple notches higher than the 400hz slider, and lastly the 6.25khz slider a tiny bit lower than the 1khz slider. This sound might not be for everyone, but it suits the music I tend to listen to most often, that being classical,jazz, and some rock. The sound with these settings is crisp, full and extremely comfortable, and by that I mean you get none of that ear-piercingly loud 10khz+ that a lot of earbuds have that is sometimes not capable of being done away with.In terms of design, I think these look absolutely beautiful. While it is very clear from size and shape comparisons that these are highly influenced by the airpods, that doesn't get rid of how amazing the case feels and looks and how amazing the individual earbuds look. Additionally, the earbuds are extremely comfortable in the ears.Now, when it comes to features, that's where these begin to fall down the tier list. The anc and transparency mode are not bad, but for the price bracket I believe that the anc and transparency could be improved. Touch controls are very responsive and accurate, but the customization is restricted to pressing and holding the earbuds, which by default switched between the sound modes.Lastly, some extra points I'd like to make are that 1) the sound separation+soundstage is very impressive, and 2) the battery is amazing; the battery on a single charge of the earbuds lasts 6hrs with anc ON and possibly 9 HOURS with it off.If the anc and transparency were better I probably would have given these 5 stars, but for the price, I believe that 4.45 stars is adequate.I highly recommend these to those into music with lots of instruments and vocals, like jazz or rock, but I probably wouldn't recommend these to bass heads.

These earbuds working straight out of the box, can connect them via bluetooth with my laptop without any additional software and these working as a headset for online meetings and conference calls. But to unleash the full potential I recommend to download the app on the phone (its compatible with iOS and Android) and set up the 'classic' Marshall sound, which goes fab with the rock music.Earbuds are touch sensitive, so pause, skip to next or pick up incoming call is easy with a few taps. The most fancy thing is a noise cancelling, which can be adjusted to personal needs (may completely isolate from the environment) and may set it to full transparency, where all the noises from the outside are amplified. I also love the design, the box and the usb charging cable looking like being taken from the Marshall guitar amp! I'm positively impressed with these and I'm happy to recommend it!  "

I am not sure of course if this is just because of the particular shape of my ears, or whether they are particularly clever design, but for me this is a key point as I hate going out with earbuds feeling that one might drop out at any moment.They are also nice earbuds. The specs are fine: 6 hours playtime with ANC (active noise cancellation) engaged, wireless charging, IPX 5 water resistance (plenty good enough for rain), and transparency mode for hearing what is going on around you. On the Bluetooth side, there is support for LBC (Low Complexity Communications Codec) which is more efficient and higher quality than the old SBC protocol.The earbuds support tap controls which I do not much like in general as they are fiddly and prone to mis-taps. You can disable them though, via an app for iOS or Android. You can also customise them to a degree. I have mine set so the left earbud turns the volume down with a long press, and the right one turns it up. You can also set them for ANC control, EQ, or voice assistant, but with just two earbuds, you have to choose.Most important, how about the sound? In general, very good. The sound is balanced, neither excessive in the bass nor the treble. It perhaps lacks the last degree of refinement you can get from high-end earbuds, but is consistently enjoyable.These Marshall earbuds make an excellent pragmatic choice, with good sound, good features, and a very secure fit.

Meine Erwartungen waren hoch undwurden nicht enttäuscht.Das Design ist außergewöhnlich - im positivem Sinne. Das gilt auch für das La-decase. Es ist wohl keinen Millimeter größer, als es sein müsste. Das Case schütztdie Kopfhörer bei Nichtgebrauch und lädt diese gleichzeitig über magnetischeKontakte auf.Die Soundqualität ist bereits in der Standardeinstellung sehr gut und klar. Fallsdas nicht genügt, kann man zwischen verschiedene Soundprofilen in der Appwählen. Ich nutze darin gerne die Bassanhebung.Zusätzlich kann das Active Noise-Canceling aktiviert und sogar individuell an-gepasst werden. Die Wirkung ist beeindruckend. Mit diesen Ohrhörern habe ichdas erste Mal bei In-Ear-Höhrern eine tatsächliche Unterdrückung der Umge-bungsgeräusche wahrnehmen können. Es ist auch ein transparenter Modusverfügbar, der praktisch das Gegenteil darstellt. Umgebungsgeräusche werdendamit über die integrierten Mikrofone verstärkt.Die kleinen Akkus in den Ohrstöpseln halten etwa 7 Stunden und können imgeladenen Case etwa 3 mal neu aufgeladen werden.Das Case lädt man per USB-C. Ein entsprechendes Kabel befindet sich im Lie-ferumfang. Dort findet man auch Ersatzstöpsel in verschiedenen Größen.Die Verbindung zum Abspielgerät erfolgt per Bluetooth. Die erste Kopplunghat innerhalb weniger Sekunden funktioniert.Um herauszufinden, welche Funktionen die Höhrer an beiden Seiten haben, mussman auf jeden Fall einen Blick in die Anleitung werfen oder die Konfiguration inder App aufrufen. Hier kann man die Belegung auch ändern.Es können auch direkte Verknüpfungen mit Spachassistenten oder Musik-Streaming-diensten wie Spotify hergestellt werden.

Die Ladeschale ist im typischen Marshal-Finish gestaltet, was sich für Rock-Musik-Fans wirklich toll anfühlt und auch sehr stylisch aussieht. Die Ohrstecker selbst erinnern am unteren Ende an den Drehregler eines Marshall-Verstärkers, außerdem ziert sie ein ""M"" im Marshall-Design. Neben einer Anleitung finden sich noch ein Paar kleinere und ein Paar größere Silikonaufsätze, ein obligatorisches Ladekabel sowie die Bedienungsanleitung im Lieferumfang. Für meine kleinen Gehörgänge sind die kleinsten Aufsätze gerade richtig.Nach der ersten Kopplung mit einem Mobilgerät muss die passende App aus dem App-Store geladen und installiert werden. Das klappte bei meinen iPhone SE (3. Generation) ohne Probleme in Sekundenschnelle. Eine Registrierung ist im Unterschied zu anderen Herstellern nicht nötigt und soweit ich es sehen konnte auch nicht vorgesehen. Meine Motif II waren innerhalb weniger Minuten komplett einsatzbereit.Der Klang der InEar-Kopfhörer erinnert tatsächlich an den typischen Marshall-Sound: laut, breit und ziemlich aufdringlich. Die einstellbare Lautstärke ist hoch und sollte vermutlich mit Vorsicht nach oben geregelt werden. Nachvollziehbar, aber nicht wirklich ""analog"", werden die Ohrhörer über eine typische Touchsteuerung bedient. Eine manuelle Steuerung (vielleicht sogar in den angedeuteten Drehreglern an der Hörerunterseite) gibt es leider nicht. Das ANC ist sehr gut nachvollziehbar und arbeitet effektiv, Telefonanrufe lassen sich direkt an den Ohrsteckern annehmen und bieten einen glasklaren Ton, auch wenn man sich einige Meter von Mobiltelefon entfernt.Zusammengefasst bewerte ich die Marshall Motif II ANC mit herzlichen fünf von fünf möglichen Sternen. Die Kopfhörer sind makellos verarbeitet, das verwendete Material wirkt sehr hochwertig. Die Inbetriebnahme klappt reibungslos innerhalb weniger Minuten, die zugehörige App benötigt keinerlei Registrierung oder Anmeldung. Was aber das wichtigste ist: Der Sound ist laut und knackig, genau so wie ich es von einem Marshall-Produkt erwarten würde.    "

Ich denke für jeden etwas dabei.Die Funktionen an den Hörern selber funktionieren gut. Die Reaktion ist zufriedenstellend.ANC funktioniert gut. Könnte nach meinem Empfinden etwas besser sein. Das Design ist wirklich TOP. Erinnert so an die Drehregler von Marshall-Verstärkern.Das Design ist typisch für Marshall.Im Großen und Ganzen sehr gute Kopfhörer mit guter Preisleistung.    "

"1755","JBL Live Flex ANC True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Rose  ","Michel","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 4 January 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Habe mir die KBEAR KS1 ohne Mic aufgrund der Empfehlung von Dankpods bestellt. Sind heute gekommen, hier die ersten Eindrücke. Sollten sich weitere Eindrücke einstellen, ergänze ich diese hier.Gute Verpackung, die eigentlichen Kopfhörer kommen da nur unwillig raus. Weiterhin finden sich in Packung dass Kabel, 2 zusätzliche Silikon-Stopfen in verschiedenen Größen und ein kleines booklet mit Warnungen, also alles wie üblich. Kabel und Kopfhörer sind glücklicherweise jeweils mit ""links (L)"" und ""rechts (R)"" beschriftet.Passform: passt bei mir sehr gut, obwohl die Ohrteile recht groß aussehen lassen sie sich gut auch länger tragen. Die sitzen bei mir sehr fest, keine Gefahr, dass sie rausfallen.Klang: wie von Dankpods geschildert und demonstriert transparent, präzise, neutral. Schöne Stereobreite. Wie Monitore. Dem gegenüber steht die KBEAR-Beschreibung mit dem Bass. Das ist Ansichtssache. Es gibt keine Bassbetonung. Der Klang ist wie abgemischt, keine Verzerrung oder billige Bassanhebung. Oxygène von Jarre, Blunderbuss von Jack White,  Axiom von Archive quergehört, passt alles soweit. Wer einen übertrieben Bass-betonten Klang sucht, ist hier falsch.Metal muss ich noch probehören und etwas Jazz auch noch. Wird hier noch ergänzt.Für den Preis fantastischer Klang, Empfehlung für jeden, der neutralen Klang mag.Ergänzung 07.01.22: weiter getestet. Auch Jazz und Rock/Metal hören sich gut an. Getestet mit E.S.T., Cæcilie Norby, Dio/Rainbow, Epica, Arch Enemy.Eine Sache ist mir aufgefallen: die KS1 brauchen  Umpf auf der Leitung. Am Notebook Ausgang hören sie sich dünn und nicht sehr differenziert an. Am Handy via USB 3 an DAC ist es ein komplett anderes Hörerlebnis. Auch wenn es sich um einen simplen inline-DAC handelt, liefert er offensichtlich deutlich mehr Power. Hinter dem DAC muss eben noch ein Verstärker sein. Hab jetzt leider keinen richtigen Kopfhörer-Verstärker, um das gegenzutesten, aber es ist mE offensichtlich.    "
"1756","JBL Live Flex ANC True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Rose  ","Oliver Rabe","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 7 May 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","        This is the second pair that I've purchased because I was really happy with my first pair and wanted a set for home and the office.First things first though: these are not noise cancelling. I would define it more as noise isolating as they seal so well into my ears that it's like I'm wearing a decent pair of earplugs.  I often wear them on the bus and I don't really notice the engine sounds or other passengers talking. The sound quality is wonderful for music and for audiobooks/podcasts. I haven't encountered a lot of distortion on higher volumes - although I do tend to not have these on full blast as I don't want to damage my hearing and I find a higher volume is often not required in my use case.These also don't have the in your face sort of bass that a lot of headphones have, which is a relief for me as I've always found that gimmicky and annoying and frankly ruined the listening experience for me in the past. But with these the sound levels are pretty even across the board, which is to be expected as these are are IEMs.  You get to hear the music more or less as intended. And I'm not sure if I'm imagining it or not, but I think percussion comes through much clearer then other headphones I've used.All in all, these are a solid pair of earphones for a really reasonable price if you take into account how much IEM's can cost.

This is my first pair of IEMs. I’mNo audiophile, so I went to YouTube to test these. Search for “ULTIMATE HEADPHONE TEST !!!” To look for the video. I tested at 35% volume. For these, the Bass went down to 20Hz, Treble went as high as 16,000Hz and the rest was also reflective of high quality earphones. Noise isolation is also very good. I’d definitely recommend these earphones for watching videos on your iPad/laptop and even for gaming. I tested on the PS5, these sounded brilliant. I even tried this as sleeping buds and they were comfortable. They are definitely a bit heavy on the bass and may not be 100% accurate, but if you’re looking for professional grade for $25, your expectations are flawed.The only thing left to see if how long these will last. Hopefully they do.  "

"1760","JBL Live Flex ANC True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Rose  ","Loonie Logic","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 17 October 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","        June 2023:  After yet again another pair of Sony MXR110's failed on me (one side always goes bad in less than a year) .. the old ""100's "" i had lasted nearly 10 years .. actually was my first Amazon purchase in 2013 and they failed Sept 2022  after HEAVY use.  Well I have been using these KS1's regularly on my walks and I do like them.  I may pickup a set of headphones to use since I am in Florida and after awhile (like with any earbud) my ears start to sweat and i rather use headphones when that happens... I still have to say I am more impressed with these KS1's overall and I liked them beforeI have a pair of (now de-listed) KSN's that were about $15-$20 like these.  Just comparing the two, these KBears sound SO MUCH better.  I MAY give the KBear KS2's a shot because of my feelings for these, but the KSN's ... they just sound off without HEAVY EQ'ing and with these i just use my standard ""V-shaped EQ""... the KSN's have an issue with the mid-mids to the highs where say guitars sound ""so far back"" and the vocals are WAY TOO forward .. almost ""louder"" then the rest of the music.WIth my older Sony Mp3 Player with Rockbox firmware, I got those to sound good in one use case (that player) .. THESE KBears just need my standard U- / V- shaped EQ and they still sound better.  And when I go after those KSN's ... Those Sony headphones I mentioned dont sound great either... they need help.... so while i love my music I am no audiophile, needing top notch gear.  These sound good ... maybe better than the Sony headphones ... the KSN' IEMs that I HAVE anyway just sound so much worse than these.To be fair .... I am POSSIBLY considering picking up another pair of these, with my bad luck with Sony Headphonesmid December update:  I have to say that with a certain media player and a certain genre i listen to on that, the KS ZSN's do not sound as off as some other players and genres with my usual U to a V shaped EQ (not a sharp V if it is a V) ... but these KS1's just sound so much better when those similiar earbuds just sound ""out of tune"" ... like the different parts of the song (vocals and music) are pulled back and/or pushed forward in odd ways.  I am not going to say these KS1's will please a picky audiophile but ... everything sounds balanced to me ... listening to a NUMBER OF genres just late last night trying my best to do an A-vs-B comparision ... the ""worst"" the KS1's were .. caused me to go ""oh .. this is well balanced but i wish it had a tiny more 'bump' in the base/sub-base"" ....I am totally fine with that ... I love my Samson SR850 headphones for instance but they have the same issue .. great sound overall .. well balanced ""everthing is where it should be"" ... but on say some rap tracks .... it could use a bit more bass.I have NO idea how KBear and ""KS"" relate to each other ... from the same parent company? .. competitors? ... but when the KS ZSN's sounded off (not TERRIBLE btw ... just off) to me ... between the KS1's cable being just a little bit better in my view and the sound of course .... it felt like the KS1's while i would not say ""they are junk"" ... it felt like they were a knock-off model of these KBears.  in the interest of fairness maybe if 'KS"" tuned them better they COULD sound exactly like these.If you are on the fence with earbuds like these ... go with these KBear KS1'supdate: WIthout just copying and pasting parts of my reviews of a similar product in the same price range (even a few $ more) ... I have to say I am MUCH more impressed with these, over the KZ ZSN Pro's I got ... with the same U to V shaped EQ I have always used with my headphones, and NO TWEAKS to that, these sound really good and impressed me right away ... the KZ ZSN Pro's in the same price range, are not tuned the way I like ... i have to drop the top end (highs/treble) to stop the ""piercing sound"" on those where you can even hear say cymbals from the drums over most everything else ... or where the vocals are so forward they seem ""louder"" than the music ... .bass wise ... I have to really bump up the EQ base that was already a U-to-V shape just to get a normal (to me) level of bass ....THESE KBear KS1's do not need any of that fiddling ... do these sound ""perfect"" or ""audiophile level""??? OF COURSE not.  When EQ'ed basically .... do they sound as good as my Sony MDRZX's that I love for walking around headphones/earbuds? ... YESI am so happy with the fact I ordered these--------------------another update: I JUST got a pair of KZ ZSN Pro's that I bought for a similar price to what I got these for and as a comparison with the same EQ settings I have always used and in my view (even if a tad bass heavy at times) ... I dont dislike the KZ's so far ... but I may even consider returning them as they have parts of the mids ... say vocals in alot of my tests (just my own ears and how i think stuff sounds) WAY TOO forward and they are lacking bass by default ... the eartips on the KZ's seem to be the exact same as these KS1's and doing a fast (but admittingly short so far) ""A-vs-B"" comparsion, I totally like the KS1's better ... everything (again a tad bass heavy at times) is right where it should be with lows, mids, and highs ... the KZ's (the model that some compare to the KS1's) to me doesn't sound as good as these do... but I admit I am still testing those ones out.  with that A-B test I mentioned ... as soon as I put these KS1's in my ears with the same song, same EQ setting, same player, I noticed a difference right away--------------------------------------Update after 3 days of using these outComfort wise after my say ... 45min to 1 1/2 hour walk during the day/early evening .... 4.5 out of 5 stars from me and not counting KZ's (which I do not have yet but ordered due to a sale and how much I like these KBears ... and a recommendation from Youtuber Dankpods as well), I still say I am not an ""earbud"" guy, but I do like these.  (Forgetting the difference between ""IEms ... In Ear Monitors"" and ""earbuds"")I have to say though that the heat and humidity here in the far south of the USA has gone down a bit since the middle of the summer, so that may effect how much I'd take the KBears out and ""just let my ear breath"" for a moment or two before putting them back in.  This is to note that the comfort overall of the default eartips for my ears (note: everyone's ear size is different, so many different ear tips ... which you can buy replacements for apparently.... and i love that), is a-ok.  There is part of me that doesn't like things stuck in my ears, but that is not saying these are bad..... this is just my own personal preference.  With the way they are made where the driver part sits OUTSIDE your ear canal ... you can push them in just a pitch if you feel them slipping out, but for me i can never ""push them in too far"" which is a really GOOD thing.Based on what I just said I have to say that while the KBear KS1's have never come close to falling out or anything... sometimes on some tracks, while out on my walks, I noticed the base ""lacking"" from what I heard earlier ... I then SLIGHTLY (with almost NO pressure) pushed the KBears into my ears ""more"" and the base came back.  With any IEM or earbud that seels the ear canal, the ear tip size vs the size of a person's ear can not only effect the comfort and passive noise cancelling, but also the sound.  Too big for ones ears and an IEM/Earbud can sound extra bassy.One thing I noticed is that SOMETIMES there was like an illusion of extra bass over different genres, but that may just be me being a headphone guy, not use to something stuck in my ears.  When i listend to genres from Rock to Rap to Smooth Jazz too, I closed my eyes just to really focus and I though ""is this too much bass, or is that that I am hearing, just due to my ear canal's being sealed and these ARE balanced sounding?"")Only long term use will tell me if the cable will be fine, versus the bad luck I have had with earbuds where within a few weeks of CAREFUL use, one side always stops working.  This is one of the reasons, other than sound quality, I had a bad taste in my mouth for earbuds (combined with my genrally good luck with my Sony XZ series on-ear headphones).Sound wise I have to say I am impressed at how balanced these are, but my fear is to OVERSTATE how great these sound.  I think these sound good and balanced, but I am sure different similar IEM's that have 5 drivers per earbud (in say the $50 or so ... US prices anyway, range), will sound a bit better.I do not want to say ""these are the best sounding things ever! OMG!""... but also if you have experience with earbuds A) Being so bass heavy the mids and highs are VERY WEEK or B) Have had earbuds that ... like many low end earbuds .. are ""mids-only"" .... THESE KS1'S are not like that.  IF anything I think they are a bit bass heavy at times, but that is with a KEY PREFERENCE of the fact that the music player I am using at the time has my usual Sony ZX series headphone EQ settings, which does bump the bass up a bit ... if i really tweaked that for not the Sony headphones but these KS1's I could get it closer to what I like ... in this case the extra bass is TOTALLY my own EQ settings, since i lowered that a bit and the ""extra bassiness"" I heard at times went down to where I'd like it.  That is totally on me/my settings.Update Summary: After Dankpods (Youtuber) recommended these I picked them up and do not regret my choice .. he also recommended different KZ brand IEM's in the same range, which I have ordered and on the way ... I can't say which is better, but unless these KS1's break...even if the KZ's KSN Pro's sound great ... .THESE ARE NOT going back.I even just returned a pair of OneOdio ""Hifis"" that I was beyond disappointed with the sound and how muddy everything sounded, despite ""They sound great"" reviews ... I was hoping the KZ1's were not like that too before I got them and glad they are not only not bad ... for in ear stuff (again I have had a bad taste in my mouth for years with this type of earbud)... these are pretty darn GOOD.----------------------------------------Original Review:I have to note that this review is still based on first impressions to a degree though I have used two of my main music players and on each (granted I did not change any EQ settings setup for my usual Sony MDRZX100's or Sony MDRZX110's that I admit do not sound great at times but EQ'ed right i think for walking around headphones that dont break the bank, sound pretty good).I have to say that while years ago I use to use earbuds more ... and had a favorite pair of earbuds in my late teen years (not sure if there were tweaked models of this over the years but they are at least close to the Sony MDR-E828LP ... or some variant if there were different models)... trying those as a new pair after my old ones broke on me, the sound really .... pushed me to be a headphone/not earbud guy ... there was like all mids in the new pairs and the prior mention Sonys became my regular headphones.  I think he may have mentioned these but I know he mentioned a similar set of earbuds .... Youtuber Dankpods AND a good sale on these made me take the risk of trying these out.  I have to say some Video and Amazon reviews do say that these sound more balanced but less ""v shaped"" (eq wise) then the KBear KS2's ... I cant say I can compare the two of them to say which sounds better.Pros:  - Comfort: ... granted that most earbuds do not go over the back of the ear (or at least none that I have had)... I was worried to a point, wearing glasses and how these would feel ... I can totally say that with my sunglasses or regular glasses this was a silly thing to ""worry"" about... this is a TOTAL non-issue and there are no problems there.  I mean I know there is a cord there but it's almost as if there isn't with the way they feel so light.  I do have to mention that eartip wise this is subjective and you may need to adjust the ones that fit right for you.  I know that having the wrong tips on, may even effect the sound ""quality' to a point too.  At the time I am typing this, I have not even opened the little bag with the extra tips.  The default (medium?) tips feel great.  Personally, I may want to take the headphones out and let my ears ""breath"" for a bit during long listening sessions, though this is NOT an issue with the earbuds ... or the tips ... I'd do this with ANY earbuds (I still am more of a ""headphone guy"")... I also have had earbuds in the past (not counting those Sony E828's) that really feel like they are going far into my ears and I dont like that ... while providing a great seal for me ... these default eartips DO NOT feel like they are pushing in too far or becoming uncomfortable quickly.  This all gets a two solid thumbs up from me on comfort.  - Noise Cancelling - Ok ... here is one I have seen people complain and give 1 out of 5 reviews on these for.  With these there is NO active Noise Cancelling and I think some people just see ""noise cancelling"" in the title of the listing and expect them to have say top-end earbud ACTIVE noise cancelling.  NOW ... I do admit that this goes with the ""get the right ear tips that fit you... "" comment ... with the default tips there is (without anything playing) reasonable PASSIVE (just from the seal of the eartips in the ear) noise cancelling and at reasonable (meaning you don't have to have music at full volume) there is VERY GOOD passive NC ... I can barely hear my small black Honeywell fan that is NOT quiet by any means, right next to me, during my testing.  REMEMBER nothing is going to truely cancel out loud voices and some noises, though I hear that different Apple and ESPECIALLY Sony's are great for that if NC is at the top of your list of wants.  NC wise I give these a two thumbs up as well  - Sound Quality - I cant say I have done tons of testing but I have (NOT CHANGING, any of my EQ settings from what I have them set to for my Sony MDR's that I mentioned ... have to note that) testing these with my Sansa FUze+ running Rockbox and my Victure M3 (no matter what I do EQ wise it never sounds as good as the Sansa players I have).... I also have listened to some Rap, Rock, Jazz and Easy Listening in my tests.  I am not going to go over the top and say these are the best sounding (note: the eq commment) but without touching my usual settings that bump up the Bass and Treble a tad .... being a fan of a ... say a combo of a U shaped EQ and a V-shaped EQ .... these KBear KS1's sound ... REALLY good.  SOMETIMES It can seem like some tracks have a touch too little bass, but other tracks that make me go ""wow... that bass is impressive for an earbud"" ... EVERYTHING I have listened to sounds clean too ... between the bass/mids and highs ... nothing seems like it's pushed too forward over the other.  SO many of the earbuds I have tried since (and even the last pair of those I tried) those Sony 828's were what I used, sound like they are trying too dang hard to prove they have alot of bass, that the mids and highs at best ... at BEST sound very muddy.  I know all of these are in the ""budget range"" so I am not expecting perfect sound, but when headphones do that sort of thing ... I can't use them  The LAST pair of Sony 828's I tried a few years back were ""all mids"" compared to earlier models (and i had a pair that only had one side working, they still sounded more balanced then the new pair I bought).  Even if I'd want to touch up the EQ at times for these KBears, SLIGHTLY adjusting the bass or treble perhaps, these sound clear in all three areas (lows, mids and highs), and from what I have heard in my tests,.... the vocals are NOT pushed back like even some headphones I have listened too.  I'd say maybe the tuning is a slight u-shaped tuning mixed with a flat tuning and I LOVE THAT.  It reminds me of a food dish where everyone can adjust or add sauces or what-not to their taste, on good foods VERSUS a ""dish"" having too much of one thing or the other, and you have to try to take something ""away"".  These are earbuds of course but ... to a point, considering that ... they have a decent sound stage ... I mean nothing huge ""forward and back"" like my Samson SR850's but ... a surprise to me for earbuds of any kind.  That clean ""tuning"" has something to do with it too, I think.  Putting everything together ... it's not like some earbuds that are ""I hear you like bass, so here is all the BASS, even if it sacrifices the mids and highs"".  This sounds more like ""Hey... here is the music you want to listen to .. we may add a TOUCH more Bass and/or Treble by default but not much .... here is your music mostly 'as-is' ""Unsure: (not con's but things to note... maybe they will never be cons)  - I know all earbuds that are wired have small wires, but these seem to be on that same track and versus the pictures the cord seems smaller than what I was expecting ... THINNER, NOT length wise.  I do love the fact that I can replace the cord (what ALWAYS goes eventually for me) if the earbuds themselves are a-ok.Note:  putting the earbuds on the wire was really easy but take note that the writing of ""L"" and ""R"" are small and while I already have messed things up... if you are careful, it's easy to take the buds off the wire.  All you have to do once you know the L and R part of the wire and L and R earbud ... PAY ATTENTION to which way the earbud is facing on like me with one of them .. you can goof up and put it on where the earbud faces OUTWARDS.  If you are careful holding the tip of the wire where the prongs are and the earbud and DON'T ""just yank them apart"" ... it's no big deal to turn that around... but I am always careful with small/thin wires myself.  I am not sure how ""heavy duty"" this wire would be depending on the use-case but the fact that it can be replaced ... was another thing besides the sound quality that drew me to taking a chance on these.I know I probably forgot something, but I think that is all I wanted to say .... as long as someone wants/likes earbuds and do not mind they are wired ... I'd 100% recommend these.  I can't of course say if these are better than the KS2's or any of the KZ products I have seen (Youtuber) Dankpods mention but I have gotten some of those bad earbuds that sound awful to me and are made cheaply for around the same price.I know this is the gift giving time of the year and even if someone has some earbuds already, I'd say this would be a great gift idea ... they may even be surprised at the difference between their default earbuds that may have say come with a phone or other device, versus the sound quality with these.

I've found, if when taking them off, if you can remember to move the little slider as far as it will go towards the ear hooks, this prevents fankling.I'm thinking in time I might want to try one of the ""pro"" version IEMs just to compare SQ, but I'm happy with these for the time being.

Il cavo invece, l’ho trovato estremamente corto, ma cambiandolo o comprando una prolunga jack 3.5mm si risolve il problema.La qualità audio è ottima, ci sono i bassi e gli alti, regolati al punto giusto. Non so se sono FLAT oppure hanno un po’ di equalizzazione interna, ma dubito, dunque meglio ancora, potrete utilizzare questi auricolari sia in studio che per altre attività.Sottolineo e concludo dicendo che l’ho acquistate per il gaming e per utilizzare il computer in maniera generale, passando dall’ascolto di musica a quattro chiacchiere con gli amici.

Young","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 10 December 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","        SOUND: I did a sound quality comparison between my Beats Dr. Dre $250 headphones and these. Besides myself, 4 other people helped me with this comparison. I used 4 different genres of music: country, classical, classic rock and traditional blues. 3 of us said these KBEARs were as good as the Dr. Dre, 2 said these are slightly better. The bass is is as loud as if you were at a live event.The noise cancellation worked fine. I did not try them with anything more than being in the same room with the television, but my family turns up the TV sound bar a bit louder than a party of voices.COMFORT: No issues with comfort. These fit perfectly and caused no discomfort at all. They also stayed put when I cleaned house.CONCLUSION: I found no real drawbacks to these earphones. Minor improvements would be a higher volume for people who like to make their ears bleed and a variety of controls on the cord. I want my music loud and these were as loud as the Beats, and without any distortion,  but I know some people want volume high enough to cause ear pain. I hesitate to even mention the volume at all because I do not want anyone to think these are not loud enough, they really are and compare well with the loudness on the Beats Dr. Dre.  Currently you can mute on the cord but everything else has to be done via the phone. Since there are no real directions with this there is a chance there are more controls and I am not seeing them. I am shocked at the low cost considering the high quality. I am buying a second set.  "

Compared to the ""Soundcore Life Dot 2"" earbuds I have been using, which are 3 times more costly, these somehow sound even wider, and seem to strangely seem have higher fidelity. In terms of comfort, they stay in the ears perfectly due to the cable structure, and sit in the ears so delicately that the user may forget that they are even wearing the ""KS1""'s within minutes; or even within seconds even. Not only that, but the actual shape of the earbuds actually lends to comfort while laying down instead of hindering it, which is a major ""plus"" for myself personally. In terms of sound cancellation, the ""KS1""s are also reasonable. I would highly recommend this product. The value is unparalleled.  "

The noise cancellation and sound quality are second to none. They're extremely loud so be careful you musicians out there that you don't damage your ears.The earbuds are perfect for those who are just listening and don't need to remove them on and off frequently because the over the ear design is meant to stay on.

Soy cantante y necesitaba unos auriculares intraurales para eventos próximos. Pero además me encanta escuchar música y apreciar todas las frecuencias y los detalles que los productores se esfuerzan en remarcar en la música. Tenía mis dudas porque de entre todas las opciones que tiene la marca escogí esta por estar de oferta y era la opción más barata, pero acerté. Lo primero es que vienen tres tamaños de almohadillas (y dos pares de cada) entre los que elegir así que sea como sea tu oreja se ajustará bien, yo uso las chiquititas y genial. No te preocupes de si la colocación del cable al rededor de tu oreja va a ser molesta porque justo a esa zona le han dado forma circular y flexibilidad así que yo al menos lo noto muy cómodo. Incluso dentro del oído, este tipo de auriculares, si el tamaño es el adecuado, son cómodos y no duelen incluso después de mucho tiempo (los auriculares intraurales rígidos al cabo de un rato duelen). Pero lo que más me ha alucinado es cómo se perciben los sonidos. Incluso a un volumen no muy elevado los graves retumban en el oído por la la calidad del sonido y la forma de las almohadillas.

"1796","JBL Live Flex ANC True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Rose  ",NA,"Verified Purchase",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","        Packaging - The pakaging is quite minimal. You get the KS1's themselves, the cable and three pairs of tips (S, M, L) in a small KZ style cardboard box. I really appreciate the minimalistic packaging. Less packaging material = Less waste. Thats always a plus in my book.Build - A Plastic body up until the sound nozzle, which is made of metal. Although they are plastic they retain a premium look and feel. The cable build and quality is in-line with other IEMs in this price point. It has a resemblance to that of the stock BL03/BL01 cable but with a slightly more robust Y split and a metal L-shape 3.5mm termination. Still I'd opt for a more robust upgrade cable.Fit - Personally I have trouble with most, if not all provided silicone tips and unfortunately these weren't the exception. This is more of a me problem and I don't fault KBear or any other brands for that matter. I opted to use some extra foam tips that I had and achieved a proper seal. Also I chose to use my KBear upgrade cable that I use on my Tri Starsea's after my initial liten with the stock cable. There's nothing wrong with the stock cable and you can do without upgrading it but personally I really like the feel of KBear's 16 core silver plated upgrade cable and use it whenever I have the chance. Once in my ears they just sorta disappear. With the plaatic build you get the benefit of a lighter housing. Of course all ears are shaped different so your mileage may vary.Sound - Simply put these are fun. You get a very well done V-shape  sound signature that slightly favors bass.Bass - Bass is nice and tight. Not exactly a ""basshead"" IEM but I cant imagine getting closer at this price point. it definitely offers a nice thump.Mids- There is some mild bass bleeding into the mids so vocals(specifically male) tend to sound a little recessed but only on more throaty, deeper tones. Female vocals sound natural and non-offensive. The mids, while laid back are still very much present and well articulated.Highs - Highs are not as fatiguing as other V-shape tuned IEMs. For comparison, my Jade Audio EA3's have a similar sound to the KS1's but the highs on the EA3 can get peircing to the point of having to take a break every 30-40 minutes. These do not suffer from that problem.Soundstage/Separation - A more in your head feeling soundstage that extended ear to ear. Not as wide as other offerings for example the Blon BL01 is a little bit wider but the KS1's just do everything else better in my opinion. Instrument separation is good but with the soundstage being narrow as it is, it can be a little more challenging to pinpoint every instrument in a given track. With that being said vocals are upfront and center.Overall the KS1's may very well be the best 20 dollars you can spend on a pair of IEMs so far. These are going to be my new recommendation to freinds and family that may be looking for an intro into better, fun sounding gear.  "

There is some clarity, some separation and somewhat of a soundstage. All this boils down to IEMs that are not stellar, but reasonably accurate (little dark), non-fatiquing and pretty easy to listen to both casually and critically.If you are on a budget, these are really a no-brainer. If you already have or can afford better IEMs these are no brainer too: they make excellent spare, hand-out or loan headphones and so on. And they still sound nice enough to listen to even when you have more expensive options.Comfort-wise these are tiny and non-obtrusive. They can be put as deeply in ear as you want, and it won't be a drastic reduction of sound if they are not all the way in. Of course, you can also put them all the way in, for me they go about as deep as etymotics go, i can't actually grab their body anymore and have to pull out via cable.Isolation is pretty good on deep fit, long-term comfort too, i can sit with those for hours. In fact they sort of disappear very soon after you place them in and i really don't feel them at all.Sound-wise they are  sort of target-neutralish, gravitating towards warm sound quite a bit. No harshness or sibilance, no boomy basses, everything is pretty neat. Clarity and separation do exist, although won't be much to write home about.Drive wise, they sound OK from iPhone+Apple dongle, plugging them in any sort of amp though noticeably increases dynamics and makes them less flat. You do get additional resolution/space when going through external DAC+Amp compared to phone, so some amping won't hurt.Summarizing, these are decent headphones. They are better than most mass-market stuff like Skullcandy, etc. They are better than most earphones that come bundled with phones (although samsung/akg ones might give a bit of run for money).10-15 years ago these IEMs would be considered extremely impressive for any price. Given the price, though, they are extremely impressive right now as well.  "

Let's start with my IEM journey so far.Besides for a couple tws pairs, these are my first IEM. The main reason I bought them: low price and I figured it would be a good enough way to see if I could stand IEMs for daily use over headphones. When I first got these, I of course started to compare them with my main headphones at the time, the Yamaha HPH MT5 with brainwavz angled pads. The first thing I noticed coming from those headphones is that the quarks obviously are lacking in sheer resolution. But again, that is obvious. These are $13. MT5s are $100. Trying to ignore that, I started listening to some music. Initially, the quarks lacked any kind of bass for me simply because the bass is boosted on the MT5. But what I remember most from that initial day of testing is being mind blown that the tuning on the quarks overall sounded more ""correct"" to me than on my headphones. I didn't really know why at the time, but the tonality of the MT5 was just off. And I preferred the tuning on something that is $13. That alone was worth it.So with that, I researched other IEMs. Long story short, I landed on the Tripowin x HBB Mele and Moondrop Aria. Mele filters caused channel imbalance after 2 weeks, and the Arias broke in a day.I also got the TRN MT1 for a great price, so I tried them and they are okay for what they are. V shaped tuning, nothing special but I was surprised that I can even enjoy music on them for how cheap they are.So... after that bad luck with qc on the 2 most expensive pairs I tried... I went back to the quarks. I had used them for about a month or 2 as a daily driver before chirstmas because I wanted to get used to them. I don't believe in driver burn-in, but I believe in mental burn-in. Man, are these things great now that my brain has fully gotten used to the tuning.The sub bass is still pretty much non-existent to my ears, but I think that is because the driver is just too small to reproduce those frequencies. Something that did change since using them more is now I feel that there is an acceptable amount of mid bass/warmth in that area. Not a ton of punch, but enough to where I don't feel like there is absolutely nothing.The mids sound... fine? I don't really have a ton to say because I am not super experienced with audio stuff yet. I will say that obviously these are lacking in a bit of detail and separation, but it's still surprising what detail and separation exists. I still find myself getting surprised at picking up some smaller details in tracks that I listen to. I just never thought I would be able to hear what I can with these. They are certainly not the best, just shocking at the price. I will say that vocals can generally get a bit shouty to my ears though sometimes. Just something to keep in mind.The treble on these seems adequate enough. I sometimes notice things getting a tad harsh to my ears but I haven't noticed distortion or anything with cymbals. I think this kind of blends in with the “shout” I was talking about. Again, surprising for how dirt cheap they are.TL;DR - Better longevity than more expensive stuff I have tried, but I have had terrible luck. The bottom line is that these are very enjoyable to listen to, and in my opinion, a no brainer for how cheap they are. Just try them, give them a REAL chance, and if you don't like them you aren't out much money. Build quality, though not great, doesn't feel like they will fall apart. I still feel like I have understated how much I like the quarks, but I am trying to be as realistic as possible here.  "

I've been into headphones for a number of years, but have never really ventured into IEM's, until I heard that serviceable sound quality could be had for basically a tenner. I didn't believe it to be honest, but though I'd take the chance on them, and I'm so glad I did! I'm not gonna say that they have comparable sound quality to 300 quid audiophile headphones, but they are definitely serviceable as a daily driver.Pretty flat and neutral with a bit of a sub-bass boost makes for a pretty pleasant sound. Not the crispiest sound by any stretch, could be a bit clearer in the upper mids and treble but the impressive sound stage makes up for that in my opinion. 9/10 for sound, (taking cost into account obviously)Comfort and build quality wise they are very impressive! Especially in comfort, they are absolutely tiny, you can barely see them in your ear when wearing, and they're perfect for sleeping with. The cable feels sturdy enough whilst also being fairly flexible. There are some sharper edges on the plastic housing of the IEM's which is a bit of a shame but all in all, well worth the moneyDefinitely worth picking up.  "

""V-shaped Headphones"". Hierunter versteht man eine Abmischung bei der die Höhen und die Bässe besonders hervorgehoben werden. Diese Ausrichtung soll besonders Spaß beim Hören machen. Naja, ich denke kurzfristig schon, aber langfristig fliegen einem die Ohren weg. Es dröhnt nur noch und man fühlt sich angeschrien.Nun zu den Quarks. Hier ist das genaue Gegenteil der Fall. Die Quarks betonen besonders die Mitten. Dies führt zu einem sehr entspannten Hören über mehrere Stunden. Insbesondere Vocals kommen natürlich beim Hörer an. Einige bezeichnen den Sound als ""neutral"". Ich finde, dass dieser Ausdruck unpassend ist. ""Natürlich"" beschreibt es besser.Wer hier die große Soundstage und Details in den Höhen und einen trockenen klaren Bass für ca. 12 € erwartet, den muss ich enttäuschen. Trotzdem solltet ihr den Quarks eine Chance geben und sie ca. 3-7 Tage täglich verwenden. Wer dann bspw. die Chu von Moondrop zum Vergleich einsetzt (auch ein richtig guter In-Ear btw) wird die Vocals als zu aufdringlich klar empfinden. Was die Quarks richtig machen, fehlt den Chu's, nämlich die sauberen Mitten. Und eins kann ich Euch versprechen: Auch euch werden sie fehlen. Also schnell wieder auf- bzw.einsetzen, durchatmen und weiterhören.Ganz kurz zum Design und zum Komfort. Mit ihrem transparenten Plastikgehäuse und ihrer geringen Größe erscheinen die Quarks dezent zurückhaltend mit einem metropolen industriellen Touch. Dies wirkt sich positiv auf das Gewicht und den Sitz im Ohr aus. Ich behaupte einmal frech, dass man mit den Teilen sogar schlafen kann. Man sollte allerdings aufpassen, dass man sich mit dem Kabel im Schlaf nicht erdrosselt. Ich habe bislang viele InEars probiert und alle haben in meinen Ohren folgendes Problem: Sie fallen schlicht alle nach einer gewissen Zeit heraus oder müssen nachpositioniert werden. Wer Gleiches erlebt hat und aus diesem Grund keine InEars mehr ausprobieren möchte und dies hier vielleicht zufällig liest, dem sei geraten, den Quarks eine Chance zu geben. Bei mir sitzen Sie selbst nach 4 Stunden arbeiten so bombenfest und unauffällig im Ohr, dass mir beim Aufstehen das MacBook unbeabsichtigt gefolgt ist.Damit bin ich auch schon am Ende meiner Rezension angelangt. Die Quarks sind einzigartig. Einzigartig aufgrund ihrer Bauweise in Verbindung mit dem Gewicht und einzigartig aufgrund ihrer Mittenbetonung. Vielleicht fehlen solche Produkte. Produkte, die einen anderen Weg gehen. Entscheidet selbst.    "

Upper midrange peak at ~3kHz may create a slightly hollow tonality at times but is rarely noticeable. Bass region lacks some texture and definition, or could simply be described as smooth and rounded. Overall separation and clarity is also decent, but struggles slightly with soundstage.The outer portion of the housing has a pointed edge around the perimeter, and so most of the pressure will be dispersed around the ear tips, which probably does not do any favors to the noticeable amount of cable noise although far from overbearing.  Otherwise the light, compact design should provide a comfortable fit for just about anyone. The included ear tips are decent, and the nozzle design also allows for some adjustment of the tips' positioning along its length.Given the price it would be unreasonable to knock Quarks down over these minor flaws especially when they compete well above their price bracket in sound, and although my pair developed a slight channel imbalance after a couple months (so unfortunately past the return window), I still find plenty of use out of them.

"1929","TOZO T12 Pro Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth Headphones with Qualcomm QCC3040 4 Mics CVC 8.0 Call Noise Cancelling and aptX Stereo Headset 2500mAh Wireless Charging Case IPX8 Waterproof Earphones Black  ","Pepe Castro","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 April 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Summary: it is an extremely affordable earphone, that sounds great, very portable, feels sturdy, and has better sound quality than what you can get at the gas station or at your local retailers.What is it? This is what is referred to as an IEM or in-ear-monitor. It is different from an earbud in that it goes in your ear rather than hang on the ear. The advantage to this is that sound doesn't leak, you can listen to your content (ie. music, movies, phone calls, podcasts) without worrying if the person next to you will hear it too.Where is this product coming from? This product is sold by a reputable Chinese company who ships it to you at no extra cost. I have bought other products from this company with an overall positive experience. Although, tracking is no up to date through Amazon the tracking number provided can be searched on many websites such as 4PX or ParcelApps.com. It takes time for it to be shipped, but it has never taken more than a few weeks once it does; which considering from where it is coming from it's impressive.Who are they? Moondrop is a company that specializes in Chi-Fi (Chinese Fidelity), they are a company primarily focused on audio quality. For this same reason even though the Quarks feels light and plasticky, the cable feels smooth and everything about its design is deliberate.Why buy these? As mentioned, Moondrop, is a Chi-Fi company, even so it is shocking how well they sound for the price. They have no business sounding as good as they do. The bass is well controlled and won't rattle your head, the mids (instruments) sound clear and the highs (vocals) do not feel harsh on your ear drums. Because they are light they are easy to carrying around and do not irritate the ear like some of the larger earphones do. For their price they make for a great stocking stuffer, or even as back up earphones if you already have a good pair.I have praised them long enough, but they do deserve it. Moondrop knew what they were doing and their 2 years of research and development for this product shows. My only complaint is that due to their size they will fall of my ears, to be fair it is mostly the left side and I might need to change the size of ear tip. The build also feels cheap, again they cost $13 or $15 (with a mic), but they also feel durable even if you were to throw it around (please don't).I ordered a second pair with the microphone, when I ordered the first time that wasn't available, to use with my phone which still has a headphone jack. It is a good gift, for others or yourself, it is a great value for the sound quality at this price. Again, even as a backup earphone you will not regret buying it.  "

Compared to the HD58x, the general sound signature is similar but more neutral to my ears. Contrary to other reviewers, I feel like there is an adequate amount of bass. While lacking for hip hop, it is great for almost every other genre of music. The only critique I have is the clarity. Songs with very complex tracks and instrumentation may sound muffled. However, for 13$, you can't ask for sundara-level clarity and imaging. The sound isolation is below average considering how small the chu's are. Overall: 4/5Build Quality - Nothing amazing, but so far I can't say it feels worse than apple earbuds. 4/5Comfort - Probably one of the lightest and most comfortable iems that I have tried. The tips fit very well for my ears and never fall out, but everyone's ears are different. 5/5Value- Can't be beaten for 13$. 10/5Comparisons: KZ ZS10 pro: Chu's have a much cleaner and more articulate sound. While they have less bass, they are also more comfortable and are 1/5th the price. I would choose the Chu's any day of the week.  "

Sound quality blows away most other in-ear headphones I have tried at a similar price point. There was a good variety of ear pieces so it was easy to get a comfortable fit. They fit my ears securely - something I haven’t been able to achieve with other headphones of a similar type. The cable is good quality and doesn’t get tangled up too much. It comes separate to the headphones themselves and can easily be swapped out for a new/higher quality one. The headphones themselves have a great build quality and the clear plastic casing means you can see the drivers inside. They are not too heavy and can be worn comfortably for several hours at a time. I have been using these paired with a Dragonfly Black DAC and lossless tracks on Apple Music and so far my experience has been great. Instrument separation is good for the price and the sound isn’t overpowered by bass. They work well for all types of music - from classical to pop and rock. They have quickly become my new favourite headphones. Overall these are great for the price and I would definitely buy these again and would happily recommend them to friends and family  "

I also have small ear canals and most buds hurt like heck or don't even fit properly. I figured after checking reviews go give these a chance. I do have over the ear Sony extra bass wireless but don't always want to use those. I liked the look when I opened the package was nice they are in fact, in my opinion, light weight as some said they were kind of heavy. I tried them with default tips and right away my ears hurt. I opened the pack of tips and got a huge surprise. They have extra small tips......I've never seen extra small tips in my life I mean they are so small I thought they were a joke at first.  I figured well let's go straight to these from what looks like default medium tips.They FIT... They immediately felt comfortable and there was no pain at all. They were snug in the ear and offered decent passive noise cancelling. I am very happy with that. I connected these to my iPhone 15 pro max using apple usbc to 3.5mm audio cable and sound was very nice. Like I mentioned I'm no audiophile but I know what music sounds like to me from cheap earbuds and headphones to my 350 dollar wiress Sony extra bass headphones. I love those for the over the ear. These are the best sounding earbuds I've gotten in a very long time. Now that could be because they actually fit nice or. ust because they actually are just that good. Also first time using an iem so no experience there either. A lot of the time my right ear sounded plugged up. These no problems at all so if you got small ear canals give these a shot with smallest tips.  "

Now, I'm no audiophile, but I am a music lover who knows enough about sound to give a reasonable account of these. For reference, in the past I've owned Shure, Sennheiser, RHA, Bose, Cambridge Audio and more that I can't remember. I DJ (through Sennheiser HD25) so mainly listen to Trance, Techno and House. These are my first foray into 'Chi-Fi' and I think I may have just become addicted.I'm not going to use clichéd terms like ""you'll hear parts of songs you've not heard before"", because that's subjective and depends what you're used to listening to your music through. But hands down, and again, for the money, these are some of the most exciting in-ears I've owned.Compared to my daily beaters (Sennhesier Momentum IEM) these are way more forward sounding, have better sound stage, better mids and sound more dynamic and responsive. They honestly blew me away, and when doing some A/B testing with my Sennheisers I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing. These things are £20 and just smashed some £100+ earphones from one of the world's most prominent audio houses into outer space! I almost considered throwing the Sennheisers into the bin!?!They are insanely sensitive and easy to drive. From the audio out on my Windows laptop, vol 20 something is more than loud enough (once we're into the 30s/40s it gets uncomfortable) whereas I had to push my Sennheisers up to 60/70.Now the caveat, and this is down to personal taste more than anything and the music I listen to - they lack a little in the bottom end and I'd like a touch more sub-bass if I was being picky. However, I'd probably get that higher up in the KZ range spending more money on some quad driver IEMs and I may just have to try something like theZS10 or ThieAudio Legacy 2's, which I'm sure will hit a little harder on the low end. I may also try some comply tips for these...If you're not into particularly bass heavy music, and want something exciting to listen to (I'd imagine Jazz would sound great on these) then these have to be on your list. Bottom line; exceptional for the money and most people would be more than happy with these!  "

And OH MY GOD was he right. These things sound amazing, fit fantastic, and are super powerful. The extra bass and treble are perfect for outside use as those are usually the stuff you lose to outside noise. I have been able to hear things in my favorite pieces of music that I’ve never heard before. The comfort is great, at first it was a bit confusing because the cord goes around your ear but I got it pretty quickly. I am stunned that these hard phones are as cheap as they are, they are so worth the money and are only $5 more than earbuds which in my opinion sound no where near as good as these do. Would 100% recommend if you want to take your listening experience to the next level.  "

Queste cuffie (a bellezza di soli 26 euro di prezzo!!!!!!) sono perfette in tutto!!!Visto il prezzo davvero conveniente, aspettavo qualcosa poco ascoltabile, utilizzabile solo per le chiamate... Ma sono rimasta piacevolmente stupita!Certo, i bassi ne hanno poco niente, ma in generale il suono è davvero pulito! SI sente bene e a buon volume, nessun effetto ""sotto acqua"" o altro che capita spesso con cuffie low cost. Sono utilizzabili anche per la musica!Ma non è finita lì!Sono perfette anche come design: ultra compatte, comodissime nella loro forma a goccia particolare ma ergonomica, con custodia minuscola! Non sono minuscole come alcune che ho avuto nel passato, ma sono quasi invisibili quando le metti e nel mio orecchio stanno belli fissi, non cadono.Per il resto, tutto classico: cuffie sono tutte e due con controlli touch (spiegati semplicemente nell'istruzione) che permettono di fare praticamente tutto senza mani (spegner/accendere le cuffie, riprodurre o fermare la riproduzione, rispondere alle chiamate e terminarle, modificare volume, cambiare il track (successivo o precedente) e azzerare gli abbinamenti via Bluetooth.Abbinamento Bluetooth velocissimo e senza alcun problema, sia su un iPhone che su un Android. Collegamento rapido anche dopo averla rimessa nella custodia e ripresa la cuffietta.La batteria dura abbastanza tanto - promette 8 ore + 16 ore con ricarica in custodia (questa infatti ha la capacita un po' bassa, ma alla fine basta e poi in un paio di ore e completamente ricaricata!). Si collega con cavetto Type C - USB (adattatore non c'era!).Istruzione è semplice e completa, ma è sono in Inglese e in Giapponese. Quindi, serve un minimo di inglese per capirla, più che altro per i controllo touch.Cancellazione di rumore - possiamo dire che è presente, ma abbastanza scarsa. E' più dovuto al fatto che la cuffia non blocca completamente l'orecchio - non ha nemmeno il gommino che si attacca e blocca entrata di rumore. Però per quel che può, lo riduce il rumore esterno!Io sono rimasta soddisfatta e piacevolmente sorpresa! Consigliatissime se non volete spendere tanto.    "

La connessione si è mantenuta stabile durante l'uso e non ho riscontrato interruzioni o scatti nel segnale. La durata della batteria è sorprendente, permettendomi di utilizzare le cuffie per diverse ore prima di doverle ricaricare. È anche utile il fatto che le cuffie forniscono un avviso vocale quando la batteria è bassa.Controlli e funzionalità:Le cuffie sono dotate di pulsanti di controllo intuitivi sulle cuffie stesse, che consentono di regolare il volume, mettere in pausa/riprendere la riproduzione.Conclusioni:Nel complesso, le cuffie Bluetooth di HOTOWON  offrono un ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo.

Auricolari senza fili dalla forma e caratteristiche singolari. Partendo dal case molto allungato e dal colore chiaro, qui si parla di una soluzione stravagante ma ben fatta. Qualità d'ascolto molto buona. Non è una soluzione in-ear ma si sviluppa al di fuori del cavo auricolare. La qualità audio in chiamata è media, l'ascolto musicale predilige i bassi. Nelle mie orecchie li trovo comodissimi. Audio molto alto e valido. Non ha un'applicazione, peccato. Il prodotto ha una durata leggermente sotto altre soluzioni. Qui si preferisce la leggerezza alla longevità. Ad ogni modo mi sono trovato felice della resa generale e della durata. Prodotto che si distingue e proprio per questo ho scelto di dare una stella in più, non sono delle cuffie banali e già viste. Prodotto che mi porto dietro sempre con me.    "

Durch meine großen Gehörgänge habe ich das Problem, dass True wireless Kopfhörer mit den im Lieferumfang enthaltenen Tips nicht richtig halten meistens.Mit den XL ear tips habe ich das Problem nicht.Alles in allem kann man höchstens über das case ein bisschen diskutieren. Vom Layout her und der Verarbeitung kann man sich nicht beschweren. Höchstens darüber, dass es nicht ganz standesgemäße Materialien verwendet. Aber ist doch wertig genug dass es mir keinerlei Abstriche wert ist.Wenn sie jetzt noch einige Jahre halten sind sie ihr Geld was sie im Angebot gekostet haben mehr als wert.Dank Angebot waren sie im Budget im Gegensatz zu den Sony WF 1000 XM5 (WI 1000xm2 musste wegen Defekt einige Zeit nach Ende der Garantie ersetzt werden - nicht Sonys schuld!)

"2157","Nokia Essential E3110 Wireless Earbuds, Bluetooth 5.1, Fully Wireless Earbuds, ENC Noise Reduction, Hands-Free Calling, Left/Right Separated, Up to 25 Hours of Music Playback, Lightweight, Green  ","🔴 Erik Del Gallo 🔴","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Italy on 6 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Quando si parla di Yamaha per quanto riguarda strumenti musicali e accessori, possiamo stare sicuri di parlare di un prodotto di altissima qualità, di un brand di altissima qualità e avere un esperienza complessiva altrettanto di qualità.Queste Yamaha TW-E7B sono un prodotto con caratteristiche al top ad un prezzo, passatemi il termine, quasi ""folle"" e un audio senza eguali.Il prodotto arriva in una piccola scatolina in cartone marchiata Yamaha, semplice e con nessuna particolarità evidente all'esterno.All'interno oltre alle nostre cuffie comprese di proprio case di ricarica, troviamo anche il cavo Usb type-C per la ricarica e vari gommini per far adattare al meglio le cuffie al proprio orecchio.Parto subito con il dirvi che non sono delle cuffie proprio compatte, infatti sia il case di ricarica che le cuffie stesse risultano veramente grandi rispetto a qualsiasi cuffia bluetooth mai provata, le dimensioni esterne del case sono di ‎6.1 x 3.9 x 4.5 cm , con un peso complessivo di 7.3 grammi.La qualità dei materiali è sublime, plastica ben curata e rifinita di un nero 8nel mio caso) opaco con una trama in nero lucido che dona un effetto davvero particolare sia alle cuffie che al case stesso.L'indossabilità invece è un punto a mio parere un po incognita, perchè io personalmente le trovo COMODISSIME nonostante la grandezza, non pesano e si incastrano all'orecchio alla perfezione, di contro però io cerco sempre di far indossare le cuffie anche ad amici e parenti, così da avere un feedback anche da altre persone, e in questo caso ho avuto molti pareri discordanti, tra chi non riusciva nemmeno a inserirle per la dimensione, a chi come me le trovava comodissime, quindi consiglio personale, se siete persone che hanno un orecchio molto piccolo lasciate perdere queste cuffie perchè anche con il gommino più piccolo tenderanno a cadere.Passando invece al comparto audio abbiamo la vera e propria magia, audio PAZZESCO già in configurazione standard abbiamo una qualità audio incredibile con un equalizzazione neutra e bassi medi e alti bilanciatissimi tra loro, bassi davvero profondi e corposi ma non troppo cupi da dare fastidio e un suono complessivo degno del marchio Yamaha, davvero approvatissimo il suono.Tramite l'app inoltre è possibile anche andare a configurare più finemente tutta l'equalizzazione delle cuffie per avere un audio personalizzato e di alta qualità.La cancellazione attiva del rumore funziona molto bene, ho provato altre cuffie di fascia alta e sono tutte più o meno con lo stesso tipo di cancellazione, quindi da questo punto di vista anche altissima qualità ma niente di più rispetto ad altre cuffie sulla stessa fascia di prezzo.Il case di ricarica come detto in precedenza è molto ingombrante, ma comunque portatile ovviamente e comodo da tenere in borsa, un po meno in tasca, inoltre grazie alla sua ingente dimensione abbiamo una notevole batteria che ci permetterà di utilizzare le cuffie fino a 22 ore di autonomia totale (6 ore + 16 ore) nella custodia di ricarica.In conclusione che dire di queste TW-E7B se non che sono delle cuffie bluetooth con la ""C"" maiuscola, hanno davvero tutto quello che si può desiderare in un paio di cuffie e tutto estremamente al top! impermeabilità, cancellazione del rumore, compatibilità con assistenti vocali e app dedicata, suono eccezionale e un indossabilità ""particolare"" che forse posso considerare un punto di svantaggio perchè diventa un prodotto che non tutti possono indossare correttamente date le sue dimensioni, ma oltre a questo neo e al prezzo sono delle cuffie a dir poco SUBLIMI.Spero di essere stato utile.

※1　書きたいことを書いたら1万文字を超える超長レビューとなってしまったので、＜＞内の節題を参考に、興味ある部分だけを掻い摘んで読んでいただければと思います。また、本レビューの1番最後に要点を箇条書き形式でまとめてますので、1万文字以上の超長文を読んで時間を無駄にしたくない方はそこだけ読んでいただけますようお願いいたします。※2　本レビューにて、防水性検証のため意図的に本機を水没させている旨の文章およびその様子を写した画像を掲載していますが、製作元のYAMAHAと本機を貶す目的で掲載しているものではありません。純粋に防水性をアピールする目的で掲載しているものです。貶すつもりなら、こんな糞長い文章で細かくレビューを書いたりしません。変な誤解をされたくないため、予め申しておきました。●＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝●＜まん丸でアイコニックでミステリアスなデザイン＞　本機を見たときの第一印象は”丸”でした。フェイスプレート部分が大小2つのまん丸で構成されるという、見た目的にもかなり象徴的デザインとなっています。YAMAHA自身はこのデザインをアイコニック（iconic: 象徴的）と評しています。確かにこんなフェイスプレートを持ったTWSは他に見たことないですね。かなり大きいのに厳つさが全く感じられないという、不思議なデザインです。　個人的にこのデザインを引き立てていると思っているのが小円の出っ張り部分で、大きな惑星（大円部分）の周囲を周っている小惑星にしか見えません（笑）　なので私としてはアイコニックというか、アストロノミカル（astronomical: 天文学的）なデザインに感じます（個人的意見）。ちなみにこの出っ張りは装着姿勢のポインタとして機能するそうです。おそらくファンクションボタンの位置を合わせる用のポインタなのだろうと思ってますが、正直ボタンそのものを頼りに調整した方が確実な上に楽です。少なくとも私からは”機能美”に映りませんでした。何だかんだ言って私的には嫌いじゃないですが、このデザイン性は人を選ぶ気がします。想像力が試されるミステリアスデザインですねコイツは。　想像の幅を広げるため（個人的想像）なのか、3万オーバーの高級機にして4色展開となっているのも面白いです。数売りにくいのにこんなに展開してきれいに捌けるのかと思ってしまいますが、コンシューマーからすれば嬉しいところです。私はダークブルーを選びました。なんかアストロノミカルっぽいので（謎）●＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝●＜装着感に関して＞　他のレビューでも言われていますが、優れているとは言えません。基板部だけでなくドライバ部も結構大きいので、耳が小さい人だと装着できない可能性があります。但し耳に入れば収まり自体はそこまで悪いものではありませんし、小円の出っ張りが耳珠に強くぶつからないように装着すれば、結構快適に装着できます。装着姿勢は自分で色々試してみる必要はありそうです。　しかし耳に収まったら収まったらで、イヤピをしっかりフィットさせるのが結構難しいです。本体がデカくて”遊び”が少ないせいなのか、イヤピが耳道の形状に追従できずに微妙に浮き気味になる感覚が出がちです。場合によっては低域が大きくスポイルされてしまいます。なので、追従性が高くてがっちりホールドしてくれるイヤピでないとフィットさせるのが難しい気がします。私は付属イヤピだとフィットさせることができず、ダブルフランジ形状のAcoustune AET06 M+サイズで納得のフィット感を得ました。私自身、付属イヤピでしっかりフィットしなかったTWSに出会ったのは本機が初なので、本機はフィッティングが特に難しい機種であるように感じました。耳が小さい方で本機をフィットさせるのは相当厳しいと思われます。　あともう1つ気になったのが、イヤピ挿入時に鼓膜が強く押されるような感覚（時には痛みも）が出やすいことです。圧が逃げず耳の中で残るような感じで、痛みを引き起こしたりイヤホンを耳から押し出そうとしたりするような力が発生しています。これがフィッティングをさらに難しくしています。上記のAET06だと上記の感覚は誘発されなかったので無事使うことが出来ました。充電ケースにもきちんと収まります。あと本機のダークブルーに近い色なのも統一感が出て善きです。　色々語りましたが、装着感においてイヤピ選びがとても重要になる機種だと思います。AET06で綺麗にフィットしたというのはあくまで私の話なので、自身で色々試してみることをお勧めします。本機を試聴しに行く際は色々なイヤピを持っていくといいかもしれません。●＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝●＜本機の真骨頂：リスニングケア・アドバンスド＞　本機で一番素晴らしいなと思ったのがリスニングケア・アドバンスドという機能です。”音量によって帯域バランスを調整することで、小音量でも迫力ある音を楽しめるようにする”というYAMAHA従来のリスニングケアをさらに拡張したもので、音楽の音量だけでなく外音に合わせて帯域バランスをリアルタイムで調整することによって、煩い場所でも小音量で迫力ある音を楽しめるようにしたものです。　実際に使ってみても効果がしっかりと感じられ、特に走行している電車の中ではオンオフの差がよく分かります。オンにすると低域が補填されて、電車の走行音がある中でもバシッと低域が聴こえます。そこまで大きく音が変わるものではないですが、聴き心地は間違いなくオンの時の方がしっかりとしています。また音楽の再生音量によっても帯域バランスがちゃんと変わっていて、他のイヤホンにあるような”音量によってリスニング感が違う”という問題が完全に解消されています。小音量でも低域がしっかり聴こえるので、ちょっと音量下げ気味でも十分なリスニングが得られます。　また、場所（外音の種類）によってきちんと調整内容が変わります。ショッピングモール内では僅かにかまぼこ型の特性に寄り、オフの時よりも僅かに音がアッパーになると言うか軽くなる印象でした。ショッピングモールの駐車場（屋外）では、オフの時とさして変わらない印象でした。外音に対して適応的に帯域バランスを調整してくれているのは間違いないです。　この機能はどんな騒音環境でも一定のリスニングバランスを保つのにも一役買うんじゃないかと思ってましたが、流石にそれを完璧にこなすことはできないようです。ショッピングモール内で聴いている時は、他の時に比べ音がすこーし浮いている感覚がありました。しかしそれなりに機能しているように思いますし、外音は様々な音域＆音量が存在し得るので、完全に適応するのは無理なのかもしれません。とはいえ、この機能をさらに洗練されることに期待を抱いてしまいます。可能性を感じることのできる技術でした。●＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝●＜リスニングオプティマイザーについて＞　本機でもう一つ面白いと思ったのがリスニングオプティマイザーと呼ばれる機能です。名前の通りリスニングをオプティマイズ（optimize: 最適化）するものですが、出力をもとにリスニング感を調整するリスニングケアとは違い、耳道の中での音をインマイクが拾って解析することで耳道の特性（システム）を同定し、YAMAHAが設定したリファレンス特性と照らし合わせてその特性に近づくよう補正するのがこの機能の役目です。分かりやすく言えば、「誰もがYAMAHAが考えた最強の耳環境でリスニングを楽しめる」ということですね。これに似た機能は他の機種にもありますが、リアルタイムで機能させられるのは本機だけだと思います。　実際に使ってみた感想ですが、オンオフでの違いが正直ほぼ分かんなかったです。てことはつまり、自分の耳はYAMAHAの考える最強の耳環境だったということですな（誇）　それは少し言い過ぎだったかもしれませんが、違いがないというのは調整する必要がない状態だったということでもあるので、これはこれでいい結果だったと思います。耳道内部の特性は耳道の個人差だけでなく当然イヤピの形状やフィッティングの位置（インマイクの位置にも影響）、密閉度によっても変わってくるので、そういった部分を補償する上でこの機能は有効にはたらくかもしれません。とはいえ完璧なものであると思えないので、あくまで保険として考えた方がいいでしょう。それでも、誰に対しても同じ音を届けられるようにするこの機能は大変興味深いです。　勘違いしやすそうなので言っておきますが、この機能は耳の特性をYAMAHAが設定したリファレンスに近づけるもので、YAMAHAが理想とする、正解と考える音に矯正する目的のものではありません。YAMAHAはこの機能により理想の音で音楽を楽しめると述べてますが、正直言い方が良くないです。自身の理想の音に近づけるのはメーカーならチューニング、ユーザーならイコライザの段階で、それらを経て作られた理想の音を最高の状態で聴く助けをするのがこの機能である、という認識が正しいと私は考えています。上述のリスニングケアと同じで、この機能を”リスニングの状態を整える助けをする”機能として見ることができれば、この機能を誤解なく、正しく使えるんじゃないかなと思います。●＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝●＜本機のノイキャン、外音取り込み機能について＞　本機のノイキャンですが、おそらくTWS界最低クラスの強さかと思われます。ノイキャン効いてるのか効いてないのかが本気で分からんとまで思うノイキャン付きTWSには初めて出会いました。低音域に関してはそこそこ消してくれますが、中～高音域に関してはほとんど消しません。ノイキャン有り無しの違いが非常に小さく、正直、遮音性の高いイヤホンの方が外音をシャットアウトするように思います。外音の種類&音量にあわせて帯域バランスを変えるリスニングケア・アドバンスドとの併用を考えた調整、と考えれば合点がいかなくもないですが、ノイキャンOFF時の遮音性とあまり変わらないバランスにしてしまっているのは残念な所で、バッテリーライフを削ってまでノイキャンを使うほどのメリットが存在しません。個人的には、リスニングケア・アドバンスドの存在価値が薄れてしまってでも、ノイキャンはもっとしっかり効かせる調整にした方が良かったろうなと思いますね。もしノイキャンが強くても、リスニングケアがリスニングにおいてマイナスに働くことはないでしょうが、リスニングケアを使わない人に対して、このノイキャンの弱さはリスニングにおいてマイナスに働くと思います。というか仮にリスニングケア・アドバンスドを意識した調整だとしたら、ノイキャン時にリスニングケアを一時的にオフにすればもっと強い調整ができたんじゃないでしょうかね。ノイキャンで外音を聞こえなくしてしまえば、リスニングケア・アドバンスドの""アドバンスド（外音に応じ帯域バランスを変える）""の部分は不要となりそうですし。ノイキャン時は効果強めのノイキャンに普通のリスニングケア、それ以外の時はリスニングケア・アドバンスドと使い分けるのもアリなんじゃないかなと個人的に感じました。　ちなみにYAMAHAが言うには本機のノイキャンはアドバンスドANCというらしく、通常のANCと違いインマイクで拾った音から外音成分を取り出し、その分だけキャンセリングすることで音声データの劣化を防ぐものらしいです。残念なのが、ノイキャンが弱すぎて他との違いがほとんど感じられないところですね。キャンセル量が小さければ、従来のANCでも当然音声データの劣化は少ないでしょう。少なくともこれでは、アドバンスドANCによって音質が保持されたとは認められませんね。この点からも、ノイキャンはもっとしっかり効かせる調整にすべきでした。アドバンスドANCの強みをアピールできていないのがもったいないように思えます。非常に優れている点があるとすれば、ノイキャンにある閉塞感が全く感じられないことです。ノイキャン無しにほぼ等しいので当たり前なのですが、、、　外音取り込み（アンビエント）機能については、とても良くできていると思います。特に外音の定位感がよく再現されていて、真後ろを走っている車の存在、果ては距離感まで認知出来るほど定位感が優れています。どこかの帯域が強調されることもないことも相まって、聞こえの自然さはトップクラスです。本機はマイクの配置がユニークで、他のTWSのように前や横ではなく上側に配置されています。おそらく、人間の耳介で反射した音を拾うためのマイク配置になっていて、人間の耳介を活かした外音取り込みが自然さを作っている一因なのかもしれません。人間がしっかりと音を捉えられるのは複雑な耳介の形状のおかげですからね。生耳で聞いている時と比べると少し明度が低いところはありますが違いはそれぐらいで、TWSの外音取り込みとしてはトップレベルの完成度だと感じました。外音取り込みに力を入れ過ぎてノイキャンがおざなりになったんですかね。。。　それでも敢えて細かい部分を述べるなら、真正面からの音の定位感が若干弱い気がします。なんか真正面だけ音が少しだけ薄くなっているというか、狭さを感じます。車の通る道路だと分かりやすく、後ろからくる車の方が少し早い（距離が遠い）段階で気づくことができます。ここは生耳で聞いている時と比べるとそこそこ違いがありますね。もしかするとマイクの位置が関係しているのかもしれません。ただ本当に真正面だけなので、意識しなければ不自然さはほとんど覚えないです。　外音取り込み重視モデルであるSONY LinkBuds Sも持ってますが、外音の明瞭感は明らかにLinkBuds Sが勝ります。生耳で聞くときのように曇りなく鮮明に聞こえる外音取り込みを求めるならこちらでしょう。ただ外音の空間表現がそこまで上手でなく、音場の広さも音楽の音場と同程度です（外音取り込みの音場としては狭い　ただし本機と比べたらの話でこれぐらいが普通のレベル）。外音の定位感は圧倒的に本機TW-E7Bの方が優れてます。人間の耳の感度に近いのはLinkBuds S、感覚に近いのは本機TW-E7Bといった感じで、どちらの方を自然と思うかは人次第ですね。自然さで選ぶなら本機TW-E7Bの外音取り込み、実用性で選ぶならLinkBuds Sの外音取り込みが合うかもしれません。●＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝●＜ゲーミングモード（低遅延機能）について＞　何と本機は音質最重要のフラグシップモデルにして、ゲーミングモード（低遅延機能）持ちのTWSです。3万オーバーの機種でゲーミングモードを搭載している機種は初めて見ました。右本体のボタン操作からオンオフすることもでき、スマホはもちろんアプリ経由でゲーミングモードをオンにできないゲームハード相手に対しても使うことが可能です。　任天堂Switchで検証してみましたが、性能は予想よりも遥かに高かったです。オフの時は体感0.3秒ぐらいのめっちゃ目立つ遅延がありましたが、オンにすると遅延がほぼ完全に無くなりました。アクションゲームをやっても違和感ゼロで、ゲーミングモデルに全く引けをとらない低遅延性です。音ゲーすら普通にできそうな気がします。正直おまけみたいなもんだろうと思ってたので、完全に度肝を抜かれました。本機で一番驚いたところです。　ただし、スマホでYoutube動画を見る分であればゲーミングモデルがオフ＆遅延が大きいとされるSBC,AAC接続でもほぼ遅延を感じることはありません。本機もそうです。なのでライトな使い方であればこの機能のお世話になることはないでしょうし、多くの音質重視モデルが低遅延機能を有していないのも不要であると判断しているからだと思います。しかし、高音質かつゲーミングモデルとして使えるTWSというのは私のようにゲームも動画も嗜む人からしたら夢のようなTWSで、そういった方にとって本機はぶっ刺さるかと。しかも本機はゲームに向いた音をもってますし（＜楽曲との相性＞の内容を参照）、ドンピシャの代物だと個人的に思います。　ちなみに言っておくと、R側の-ボタン（前側のボタン）3連打でゲーミングモードのオンオフを行うことができます。なぜこんなことを言うのかというと、付属のガイドにこのキー説明がなかったためです（後述）。親切にもキー操作の割り当て表を画像付きで投稿してくれている方がいるので、そちらを参考にされるとよいかなと。●＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝●＜ユーザビリティ（操作性・接続安定性など）について＞　操作性はボタン式ということもあって行いやすいです（本機の大きさだったらタッチ式でも使いやすそうですが）。また連打操作の判定が優し目で、そこまで高速で連打しなくても認識してくれます。ものによっては判定がシビアすぎて難しかったりするので、ここの部分はユーザーに優しい作りで好印象です。本機はボタンが3つ存在するので最初は操作にかなり戸惑いましたが、慣れてしまえば全く問題なく使えるようになりました。ボタン数が多いおかげでゲーミングモードをオンオフするキーもきちんと割り当てられていて、ゲーム機相手でも問題なくゲーミングモードを使用することができます。唯一の不満点は、クイックスタートガイドにゲーミングモードのキー説明が無かったことです。私はYAMAHA公式の本機紹介ホームページに訪れて、ゲーミングモードのキー内容を知りました。どうせ本機はアプリでキーアサインできないので、ガイドに一緒に書いておいてほしかったですね。おかげで、「アプリでしかオンオフできないならゲーム機で使えないじゃん、ゲーミングモードのくせに」と不満点にしてしまうところでした。　接続安定性に関しては、なかなか良い方だと思います。ここが一番心配していたところだったのですが、きちんと仕上げてくれたみたいで安心しました。家電量販店内でもaptX接続で安定して使えていたので、実用上ほぼ問題無しです。プレーヤーとの位置関係をちょっと意識しないと途切れさせてしまうかもしれません。私の場合、家電量販店内でプレーヤーを左ポケットに入れたら音が一瞬途切れたことがありました（親機は右本体側）。最悪途切れるようなら、SBC,AAC接続で対応できると思います。　また、本機の防水性能はIPX5相当と高級TWSとしては非常に高いものを持っています。このIPX5相当はスポーツモデルのイヤホンに匹敵するレベルで、水道で水洗いしても大丈夫なほどの防水レベルです。3万円オーバーのTWSでこの防水性能はとても心強いです。で、何をとち狂ったのか、本当にそれぐらいの防水性能があるのか試したくなったので、人肌くらいの温度の水を入れたコップに1分間本機を沈めてみました（写真参照）。コップの水から引き揚げて分かったのですが、めちゃくちゃ撥水しますね（写真参照）。その後水気をふき取ってから使ってみましたが、きちんと充電もできますし、音も変わりなく聴こえますし、ボタン操作も問題なく行えました。自分の目や耳で実際に確かめられたので、防水性能に関しては信用できます。それにこんな無茶なことができたのは、YAMAHA品質を信用していたからってのもあります。ですが念のため言っておきます。絶対に真似しないでください。一応自己判断で軽めの水没状態に止めて検証してますが、同じようにやって壊れない保証はありません。もし試して壊れたとしても、責任は一切取りません。　専用アプリHeadphone connectについても触れておきますと、ます非常に動作が軽いです。自分はWalkman A100シリーズで動かしていることが多いですが、全然苦もなく動かせます。但し他の方も言っているようにできることの少ない簡素なアプリで、簡単なイコライジング（プリセットもなしで完全にマニュアル式）と本機が持つ各機能のオンオフぐらいしかできることはありません。ノイキャンの強さや外音取り込みの効果を調整することもできませんし、キーアサインを行うこともできません。本当に最低限の機能だけが収められています。個人的には無d…情報量の少ないアプリの方が好きなので好印象ですが、正直イコライザーでプリセットが用意されていないのはなかなか手厳しいなと感じます。自分もそうですが、プリセットをベースに自分なりの修正を加える人が多いと思うので、後のアップデートでプリセットの追加ぐらいはしてほしいですね。●＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝●＜通話音声品質について＞　本機は外音取り込みが非常に良くできていたので、通話音声品質についても見てみようと思いました。ちなみにZoomで検証してます。あと、上記の防水性能検証後にやってます。つまり水没後での検証です。　実際の性能としてはcVcノイズキャンセリングが効いている印象で、人間の声を綺麗に抽出してくれます。低音域はバッサリカットしてくれるので、空調や換気扇、PCのケースファンの音なんかは完全に消せます。高音域はそこそこ拾ってしまいがちです。大半のTWSはcVcノイズキャンセリングを採用してるので、この辺の性能は他のTWSと同じです。一応本機は高性能MEMSマイクを積んでるらしいですが指向性はほぼなく、周りの音は余裕で拾ってしまいます。ビームフォーミングらしきものは本機にはなさそうです。そのため、人混みのなかだと少し通話は厳しいかもしれません。　但し、感度に関しては相当高いです。最初妙に感度が低くて焦りましたが、単純にマイクの穴に水気が残ってただけで、水気を飛ばしたら感度が戻りました（笑）　ヒスノイズもほとんどなくて、通話音声の質自体はとても高いと思います。感度以外に他との差を感じるのがフラットに声を拾えていることで、マイク音声にありがちな濁りやくぐもった感じがかなり少なく、明瞭度は他機種の通話音声とは一線を画します。この辺はマイクの性能差が顕著に表れていると思われます。ハキハキと喋れば、人混みの中でもしっかり相手に声を届けられそうです。●＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝●＜”場”を見せる空間表現の天才　これぞアーティスト＞※一般的に全音質機能オフでの音質を評価すべきかと思いますが、本機の音質機能は「最適なリスニング環境を保証する」目的のもののため、リスニングケア・アドバンスドおよびリスニングオプティマイザーがONの状態での音質を本機の真な音質として評価することとしました。以下の音質レビューをお読みの際はその点ご了承下さい。　外音取り込みの自然さが凄いと前述しましたが、それも本機の音特性あってこそなのかもしれません。本機の音を一言で言うなら”場”を完璧に表現するサウンドです。演奏者の熱量を伝えるというより、演奏者達が作り出す音空間を精緻に表現することに重点を置かれています。本機はリアリティのある音楽を奏でるのではなく、リアルに音楽を演奏するような機種です。これが他のハイエンドTWSと本機との決定的な違いだと思います。音が奥まっているというレビューがありますが確かにその通りで、本機はめいっぱいの広さの空間に各音を配置して音楽を作ります。さながらアーティストの様です。　帯域バランスに関してはフラットをベースにしていて、リスニングケア・アドバンスドやリスニングオプティマイザーによって都度都度帯域バランスの調整を行う感じです。特にリスニングケア・アドバンスドは外音によっても帯域バランスを変えるため、走行中の電車やバスの中ではフラットから弱ドンシャリ系のバランスにシフトすることもあります。それによって走行中の電車やバスの中でも、フラットな特性で音楽を楽しめます。但し前述したようにフィット感が悪いと低域が一気に萎むので、きちんとフィットさせることが肝要です。　YAMAHAが制作したTWSだけあって、楽器の音は極めてニュートラルに聴かせてくれます。余計な味付けもなく、そっくりそのまんまといった感じです。しかしなにより楽器毎の定位がしっかりと表現されていて、音から現場の空間がイメージできるほど”場”が見えます。コントラストの強いビビッドな音傾向でないのに、これほど”場”の様子がはっきり見えるのはとても素晴らしいと思います。　ボーカル表現はどうなんだといいますと、定位感が優れていることもあってきちんと立って聴こえてきますし、味付けがないからこそ細かい表情やボーカルが置かれている場が良く見えます。臨場感という意味ではボーカルも非常に良く表現されていると思います。ただ、今どきの楽曲のボーカルだと表情が見えづらくてつまらないと感じてしまったのも正直です。今の楽曲はコンプの強い音の塊みたいなのが多く、ボーカルの場を感じ難いものが多いのが原因だと思います。ボーカルが埋もれずに明瞭に聴こえるという点では本機も十分満足できるものでしたが、本機の強みである音響表現力があまり活かされてないなと感じました。今どきの楽曲でボーカル表現を大きく重視するなら、本機はあまりいい選択にならないと思います。　楽器の音に含まれる細かなニュアンスを逃さず聞き取りたい方、楽曲の中に含まれる音を場として感じ取りたい方に対しては、本当に素晴らしい音を持ったTWSだと思います。YAMAHAのホームページで「歴史に名を残す名演・名盤は、その空間表現までを含めて一つの作品になっている」という文言を見ましたが、それを完璧に表現できる”アーティスト”と呼ぶに値する名機です。事実、サウンドクオリティ自体はTWS中トップレベルだと思います。ただ、上記以外の方には本機の3万オーバーの価格が高く感じられる可能性は大いにあるでしょう。本機の音の嗜好はどちらかと言うと、高級据え置き機で音楽鑑賞を嗜むガチ勢向けだと思いますね。他のTWSとは音楽の奏で方が結構違うので、無試聴で購入するのは危ない機種です。試聴は必ず。　個人的に本機の音は、ライブが好きな方に凄く刺さるんじゃないかと思ってます。帯域のバランスだとか解像度だとか、イヤホン・ヘッドホンの音の良さを示す指標は色々ありますが、本機の音をそういった部分で評価すると実は物凄く良いわけではないんですよね。なのでこの機種の音は同価格帯の他機種と比べてもそこまで音良くないって評価があるのも納得できます。しかし本機の音は演奏現場にリスナーを連れていってくれるような感覚が強く、音楽を音だけでなく姿形を持つ実体として感じさせてくれる良さがあります。それが、本機の音が持つ非常に素晴らしいところだと私は思います。●＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝●＜楽曲との相性＞　本機の音は基本ジャンルを選びませんが、あまり相性が良くない、というか本機の強みが活かされにくいのは空間情報が乏しい楽曲です。先述のYAMAHAの言である「歴史に名を残す名演・名盤は、その空間表現までを含めて一つの作品になっている」の思想に忠実に従った本機では、空間表現が潰されてしまっている楽曲だと真価を発揮できません。全部の音がはっきり聞こえるように調整されたポップス系でこういった傾向のものが多いですが、正直楽曲次第だと思います。そこまで考えてるとキリがないので、基本、苦手分野の少ない万能選手と捉えてくれてもいいと思います。本機の強みを活かしにくいだけで、決してレベルが低いわけではないです。　逆に相性がいいのが空間表現力を存分に生かせる楽曲です。クラシックはもちろんのこと、ロック（特にクラシックな70～90'sものが相性バッチリ）、ライブ音源や生録音源、歌謡曲、ジャズボーカルもの、ゲームのサントラなんかであれば本機は全力を発揮できます。要は、実際に楽器を使って演奏しているような楽曲や、音を立体的に散りばめて遊んでいるような楽曲が非常に向いています。空間表現力を活かすという意味では映画・ゲームにもかなり向いていて、本機で映画・ゲーム音楽を聴くと映像内の場の雰囲気とうまくリンクして、より深く楽しめちゃいます。音楽の空間表現力が映像作品に多大な影響を及ぼすということを、本機を使うと実感できるはずです。特に、お気に入りのゲーム音楽を本機で聴いてみて欲しいですね。本機は低遅延のゲーミングモードを搭載してますし、正直高級なゲーミングモデルとして本機を選ぶのも全然アリだと思うぐらいです。定位感はTWS界トップと言っていいレベルなので、FPSなど音を頼りにするゲームでも活躍できるでしょう。　あと意外なことに、インディーズや創作のようなアマチュアの楽曲を楽しむのにもかなり向いています。メジャー盤は聴き応え重視で空間を削るようなコンプやミキシングがなされているものが多いですが、インディーズや創作の楽曲はその辺の仕上げが甘いせいか空間を感じる余裕のある曲が多いです。アマチュアならではの作り手の音遊びを存分に楽しめるので、アマチュア音楽を色々聞いてみたくなること間違いなしです。（2022/7/12追記）　後から和楽器系も聴いてみたのですが、なんで今まで聴いてこなかったんだと後悔するくらい相性が良いです。上で挙げてるものと比べても相性トップだと思います。和楽器系楽曲をTWSで聴くならこれ以上はありません。　追記としてついでに言うと、上述の水没から2週間以上経つものの全く問題なく使えてます。一応生存報告ということで。●＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝●＜総評＞　本機は、空間表現に重きを置くYAMAHAの音のフィロソフィーを体現したようなTWSと言えます。この価格帯の中でも一線を画すサウンドクオリティを誇り、クリエイターの意図すら汲み取るような空間表現力はTWSとして突出したものを持っています。機能性を重要視する自分ですら、音だけでも3万円出して購入する価値があると感じられたイレギュラーなTWSであり、同価格帯の有線イヤホンと同列扱いできるほど希少な存在です。　また、高音質のゲーミングモデルとしての需要を完璧に満たせるような性能を持っていて、ゲーミングモデルとして売りに出されても許される完成度を誇ります。この点が最も衝撃的でした。空間表現力の高さがゲームや映画を楽しむうえでかなり活きるので、ゲーミングモデルをお探しの方にも是非注目して欲しいモデルです。　本機の音よりも気になっていたリスニングケア・アドバンスド、リスニングオプティマイザーについては、今後の可能性を感じる技術でした。”どんな人・時・場所でも最適なリスニング環境を提供する”という思いを強く感じられます。TWSそのものの音質を追求している製品はたくさんありますが、その音質の全てをリスナーに伝えきる工夫をもった製品は少ないですし、それをリアルタイムで適応的に行えるのは本機しかありません。いろんな場所で使うことを想定されるTWSだからこそ、リアルタイムで行えることの意味は非常に大きいと思います。　本機の欠点は耳が小さい人だと装着すらできなさそうなサイズ感と、イヤピを厳選するほどのフィット感の悪さにあります。誰にでも最適なリスニングを提供できる機能があるのに、装着感的に誰にでも使えるTWSでないのがとても残念に思います。それとこの価格帯としてはノイキャン効果がかなり弱く、効果が弱すぎてご自慢のアドバンスドANCの有効性が見られなかったのももったいなく感じたところでした。　人によっては装着が難しいTWSになってしまったものの、フラグシップを名乗るに相応しい製品です。リアリティのある音の完成系と言っていいTRUESOUNDを、是非貴方も体感してみてください。●＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝●（項目別評価）●音質：☆5.5空間表現力に秀でたTRUESOUND。TWSの中では空間表現力が突出して高く、楽曲の”場”が見えるような臨場感が圧倒的なリアリティを作っている。ゆえに本機の真価を引き出すにはソースをある程度選ぶ必要があり、空間をあまり感じられない楽曲に対しては実力を発揮しにくい。ガチ勢嗜好の音質でこの音を出せるTWSは他にないが、だからこそ購入前に試聴しておくことを強く薦める（装着感の確認の意味も含めて）。個人的にはライブの生演奏が好きな方、現地の空気を肌で感じることが好きな方は凄く好きな音だと思う。本機の音にはバランスの良さとかクリアネスとか概念的な部分ではなく、人の感覚的な部分、概念的なところとは違った次元に良さがある。和楽器との相性が非常に良く、是非本機で和の楽曲を聴いてほしい。秘めたるサウンドクオリティはTWSの中でも間違いなくトップレベルで価格帯最高峰。そのため満点評価を0.5超えて星5.5評価とした。●低音の音質：☆5ニュートラルな特性。かなり深い帯域まで制動を効かせて鳴らすことができ、本当に綺麗に低音が鳴る。深い部分までしっかり出るので迫力も十分。リスニングケア・アドバンスドによって量感が変わるので色味が多少変わることもあるが、基本的にどんな場所でもニュートラルに聴かせてくれる。フィット感がお世辞にもいいとは言えないので、そのあたりで低音がスポイルされないように注意。余すことなく低音を綺麗に鳴らせていることから満点評価とした。●安定性（Bluetooth接続）：☆4aptX接続で家電量販店のイヤホンコーナーをうろついても途切れることなく安定している。プレーヤーを左ポケットに入れて使っているとたまに途切れてしまうことがあったが、プレーヤーとの位置関係に気を付けていればaptX接続でも問題なく使える。少し厳しいようならSBC,AAC接続で使えば対処可能。生活内であればほぼ問題なく使えるレベルだが、完璧ではないので星4評価とした。●＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝●（使用環境）接続機器：SONY Walkman A100 Series（DAP）, 京セラ URBANO V04（スマホ）, 任天堂 Switch（ゲームハード）イヤピ：Acoustune AET06 M+サイズ●＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝●（レビュー要点まとめ）●デザイン：大小2つの真円からなるまん丸ミステリアスデザイン。4色展開なのが嬉しいポイント。●装着感＆フィット感：ともに良くない。デカすぎて耳が小さい方は耳に収めることすら難しい。収まったとしてもイヤピをフィットさせるのも難しいという2重苦。付属のものでフィットしない可能性も高い。イヤピはしっかり厳選すること。●リスニングケア・アドバンスド：楽曲の音量や外音に応じてリアルタイムで帯域バランスを変え、リスニング感を一定に保つ機能。秀逸な出来。どの音量でもリスニング感が変わらないのがお見事。完全でないが、場所（外音の種類）に適応してリスニング感を概ね一定に保てているのも良い。●リスニングオプティマイザー：ヤマハが考える最強の耳環境（リファレンス）で聴いた時と同じになるように音をリアルタイムで自動調整する機能。自分の場合、オンオフしても変わらずで効果のほどは不明。しかしオンオフしても変わらないと言うことは調節する必要がそもそもなかったということなので、これはこれでいいのかも。●ノイキャン：効果はかなり弱めでTWSの中では最低クラス。低音域はそれなりに消すが、中～高域はほぼ消さない。おそらくリスニングケア・アドバンスドと合わせるための調整。ただ弱すぎてバッテリー削ってまで使うメリットが感じられず、さらに独自のアドバンスドANCによる音質劣化防止アピールもノイキャンが弱すぎて判断できないため、この調整は正直失敗寄りだと思う。明らかにいい部分があるとすれば、ノイキャンによる閉塞感が全く感じられないところぐらいか。●外音取り込み：非常に良くできている。定位感が非常に良く、TWS越しに聴いていると思えないほど音の向きや距離感を正確に認知できる。若干明度に欠けることと真正面の定位感が僅かに劣ること以外は素晴らしい完成度。●ゲーミングモード：非常に良くできている。任天堂Switchで試したところ、アクションゲームをやっても違和感ゼロ、音ゲーすらできそうなほどの性能。ゲーミングモデルに匹敵もしくは超えてすらいる性能で、正直一番驚かされたところ。ゲーミングモデルとして本機を選ぶのは十分アリ。というかオススメしたい。●操作性：安心の物理ボタン式。連打キーの判定が緩めで行いやすいのが好印象。●接続安定性：そこそこ良い。aptX接続で家電量販店のイヤホンコーナーをうろついても基本大丈夫。プレーヤーとの位置関係でたまに途切れることも。しかし生活で普通に使っていく上でなら十分な性能。●防水性能：IPX5相当。水道水でイヤホンを水洗いできるレベル。水の入ったコップにフラグシップ機を1分間水没させるという暴挙に走るも、問題なく本機は生還。本機の防水性能は信頼に足る。但し肝が冷える上に最悪破壊してしまうので絶対にやらない方がいい。●アプリHeadphone connect：簡素かつ単純明快で動作も軽く使いやすい。機能性は薄く、ノイキャンや外音取り込みの強さの変更やキーアサインを行えない。イコライザーも大雑把なもので、何よりプリセットが用意されていない。流石にプリセットくらいは今後用意して欲しいところ。●通話音声品質：cVcノイズキャンセリングを採用しており、声の抽出具合は他のTWSとほぼ一緒。指向性は弱く、周りの声も拾いやすい。しかしマイクの性能はかなり高く、声を高感度かつフラットに拾ってくれる。ヒスノイズも少ないため、通話音声の質はTWSとしては非常に高い。ハキハキ喋れば、少し騒がしい中でもしっかり声を届けることができる。●音質：”場”を見せるアーティスト気質のサウンド。帯域バランスはフラットベースだが、リスニングケア・アドバンスドによって多少変動する。空間表現力はTWSの中では突出しており、めいっぱいの広さの空間に楽曲内の音を配置して音楽を作り出す。それゆえにソースを選ぶ一面があり、ロックやクラシック、オーケストラなど楽器の定位感を大事にする楽曲や、ゲーム、創作ものの楽曲など空間表現を詰め込んで遊んでいる楽曲などでないと全力を発揮することが出来ない。聴き応え重視で音の塊感が強いポップス系だとあまり冴えないことが多いため、その辺を考慮して本機を購入するかどうか考えた方が良い。というか購入前の試聴を強く勧める。和楽器との相性がめちゃくちゃ良いため、和の楽曲を多く聴かれる人にとっては間違いなく現時点でTWS中最高音質を誇る。

Ed io fino ad ora non ho mai trovato alcun problema in prodotti di fascia medio/alta di questo marchio, sempre rimanendo sulla categoria audio/musica. È anche il caso di queste cuffiette, che a livello costruttivo e di design personalmente mi piacciono un sacco, bello il colore e qualità costruttiva ottima che si nota subito al tatto.👉🏻Altra cosa che ho notato fin da subito è la scelta di Yamaha di integrare dei stati funzione di tipo fisico. Questo nonostante i singoli auricolari siano molto piccoli e lo spazio molto limitato. I tasti fisici svolgono diverse funzioni in base a quante volte vengono premuti, e devo dire che mi ci sono trovato molto bene rispetto a dei comandi a sfioramento che spesso fanno cilecca specialmente con sudore e mani sudate annesse, mentre qua una volta presa la mano con la posizione dei tasti e le funzioni si riesce immediatamente a svolgere ciò che si vuole, che sia aumentare il volume o cambiare traccia o ancora rispondere/chiudere la chiamata.📱Ovviamente regolabili a piacimento grazie all'app dedicata di Yamaha facilmente scaricabile per tutti i dispositivi iOS/Android. Semplicissima inoltre la connessione delle stesse cuffiette che vengono riconosciute quasi istantaneamente. Testate in abbinata con il mio Galaxy note 10 e nessun problema di connessioni riscontrate, anche durante il movimento ad esempio facendo esercizio fisico/corsa.🔋Batteria di durata abbastanza buona a mio parere. In linea con i maggiori produttori e sufficientemente longeve per un utilizzo medio, 8 ore circa dichiarate per le cuffiette (senza funzioni extra attive e volume medio diciamo) che risultano abbastanza veritiere anche se dipende sempre dall'utilizzo. Queste ore diventano poi fino a 29 considerate le 21 ore di ricarica aggiuntive fornite dalla custodia. Custodia con funzione di ricarica rapida mediante cavetto USB tipo C che consente di ottenere un autonomia di 1 ora circa in 10 minuti di carica o autonomia completa in 2,5 ore di ricarica.💶Per un prezzo attuale di 180 euro circa direi che si tratta di ottimi auricolari in generale. Curati costruttivamente parlando e comunque ricchi di funzioni compresa l'ANC, cancellazione del rumore attiva.👍🏻👍🏻In definitiva per me promosse, se siete affezionati al marchio devo dire che si tratta di ottimi auricolari con un audio chiaro e pulito, bassi e alti di buona qualità e suono davvero buono in generale. A me personalmente sono piaciuti, non eccellono certo come prodotto ma rispettivamente al prezzo che costano la qualità c'è senza dubbio. Perché consigliarli rispetto ad altri? Beh sinceramente non saprei rispondere in maniera definitiva, si tratta comunque di un prodotto dove lo studio e la qualità non manca, vi è la cancellazione del rumore e l'ambient sound, la durata della batteria è tutto sommato molto buona, ne consegue che come tanti altri nella stessa fascia di prezzo risultino degli auricolari tecnicamente ottimi in generale.

Nonostante l'ingombro non sono fastidiose e le ho indossate a lungo senza fastidi. Rimangono comunque molto sporgenti e a mio avviso non per tutte le orecchie, chi le ha piccole per me farà fatica a indossarle.La canzone che uso per testare tutte le cuffie è ""Stratus"" di Billy Cobham, perché ha un buon mix di frequenze e un dettaglio nel secondo pre-ritornello che sembra ""esistere"" solo nelle cuffie più premium e valide.La definizione dei colpi di batteri è chiara e il suono dei piatti è brillante, anche se gli strumenti a corda sono un po' più in sottofondo di quanto sono abituato a sentire con ad esempio le Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2.La cancellazione del rumore è dove queste cuffie brillano davvero.  Anche se non sono andato in luoghi molto rumorosi come aerei o treni con loro, le ho indossate durante la mia giornata tipo. Non riescono a eliminare del tutto i rumori esterni ""casuali"" come un cane che abbaia di colpo, ma a malapena riuscivo a sentire il segnale acustico del mio microonde o della mia cappa standoci di fronte.La modalità ""trasparenza"" invece l'ho apprezzata molto, è più un amplificazione forzata delle voci attorno a noi.In conclusione, forse non le comprerei per essere le mie cuffie principali, poiché penso che ci siano true wireless migliori e più comodi su questa fascia di prezzo.  Tuttavia, se cercassi delle true wireless in-ear di cui la cancellazione del rumore fosse la principale funzione accompagnata da un sound di buon livello, le prenderei al 100%.    "

They pair easily with my phone (also a Samsung), the touch controls are reliable and responsive. I especially love the ability to long-press one earbud to open and play Spotify, this removes the ""insert earbuds, get phone from pocket, unlock phone, start Spotify, put phone back"" dance.They're also very comfortable. I have big, sitcky-out ears and these are smaller and fit much more nicely than the Sony ones. Wearing them for several hours is fine.One area where the Sony ones win is noise canceling. The Galaxy Bud 2 Pros are pretty good, but the Sonys were better. If you want distraction-free listening, these are good enough. If you need to he absolutely cocooned with your music to the exclusion of everything else, these might not meet your needs.  "

The only ANC experience I had so far was when my husband was talking to me while I was in my phone watching a video, dead of night and I couldn't hear him! Haha!Battery - don't get to use it that much but I guess battery life has been pretty good.My only gripe is that it gets easily scratched, though it was my fault because I chucked it in a small bag together with a USB cable. Almost indiscernible but makes silly ol' me just a teeny tiny bit sad. Then my screaming toddler tackles me and I forget all about it. 😂Glad I got this on sale a few weeks ago, a lower price than it was during the Amazon Big Smile sale some few days ago. And delivered on the same day, no less! Amazing Prime! 👍🏻  "

Le cuffie rispetto al terzetto arrivano ""solo"" seconde, ma perché superate di poco dalle JBL che hanno un suono più pieno sui bassi. Sony: la grande delusione (la faccio breve: toni inesistenti). Acquistate peraltro senza accorgermi che NON HANNO IL MICROFONO, ma è colpa mia che non avevo letto bene. Rispetto le altre due, comunque rimangono cuffie sonoramente molto carenti. Tornando alle Marley, per quanto riguarda il resto solo aspetti positivi: cavo che non si aggroviglia, uscita del cavo a 90° (comoda quando hai il telefono in tasca), buon audio anche con le telefonate; buon microfono e soprattutto ben isolato dai colpi esterni e dai rumori dei colpi sul cavo (l'interlocutore apprezzerà). Mancano i tasti del volume, ma al prezzo pagato (ripeto, in offerta) francamente ci passo sopra senza problemi. L'aspetto anche mi soddisfa: il corpo delle cuffie è in legno di buona fattura, gommini di misura inferiore forniti, bella anche la conferzione. Il jack non è dorato, ma per prodotti che di solito durano pochi mesi non è assolutamente un problema. Veniamo all'audio, visto che ascolto spesso musica: se si viene da cuffie ""scrause"" il primo impatto è di meraviglia: ci sono gli alti, i bassi (non invadenti, ma ci sono) e il suono è ben nitido: se l'audio è di qualità, nelle canzoni si capiscono bene le parole. Isolano dall'esterno ma non troppo (e in macchina non è uno svantaggio). Vengono seconde perché le JBL (pagate solo 2€in più) hanno un audio ancora migliore. Ma direi che senza un confronto diretto queste cuffie non sfigurano, anzi! Insomma, cuffie promosse a pieni voti.    "

You wouldn't expect much but I was attracted by the name and the fact it uses wood and fibre which are hopefully more sustainable . They look good. They actually do sound very good. I left them to play by themselves for quite a few hours to semi burn them in and they have a good ,balanced ,non coloured sound. The bass is there when it's meant to be. The tones feel solid and real. As a easy carry,back up set of earphones  They are perfect. My Sony Studios or Bose Bluetooth are the primary but these are brilliant as a light ,non bulky ,sitting in a cafe listen. Thumbs up.P.s. I listened to The Damned,some Psy Trance,Ambient,ABBA .

Ich bin kein Audiophiler und brauche nicht immer super Klang. Für den Preis ist der Sound perfekt, mehr kann man nicht erwarten. Es gibt ein Grund, warum Bayerdynamics, Sennheiser und Co. ihren Preis haben. Ausschlaggebend war für mich der Preis. Hatte viele Kopfhörer (in-ears, Wireless mit Bügel) und alle sind tot. Selbst 60€ teure von namhaften Marken starben am Kabelbruch. Das Wireless hat leider den letzten Flug nicht überstanden. Ging nach dem Scannen einfach nicht mehr. Keine Lust ständig viel hinzubrettern, um dann nach 2-3 Jahren neue kaufen zu müssen. Wenn diese hier draugehen tut es dem Geldbeutel nicht weh. Die Dinger tun, was sie sollen, schauen halbwegs gut aus, die Kabel sind gesleevt und man kann damit auch im lauten Zug seine Musik oder Videos genießen. Glanzleistungen braucht man nicht erwarten.Update 2022: seither bin ich noch bei meinem 2. Paar. Erstes Paar ist irgendwann am Kabelbruch gestorben. Nutze es hauptsächlich zum Arbeiten und am Handy sowie für Calls unterwegs. Die Schallisolierung ist erstaunlich gut. Man hat sich bei mir schon mal beschwert, dass ich zu laut telefoniere. Klangqualität wie gesagt vollkommen in Ordnung. Da es jetzt 3 Jahre seit dem Erstkauf ist, halten sie doch recht lange. Beste Kopfhörer, die ich hatte nach Preis und Leistung. Weiterhin 5 Sterne. Dafür stehe ich mit meinem Klarnamen.    "

(Terzo acquisto di questo modello).Arrivano in una scatola in cartone molto in stile Bob Marley e gli auricolari sono incastrati in uno strato di plastica e vanno levati delicatamente.La mia versione prevede il microfono per mia scelta.Materiali: come da descrizione. Il legno  di ottima qualità, liscio e con l'iniziale appena sopra il punto di contatto cuffia-cavo, riveste tutta la struttura dove all'interno è contenuto il driver da 9.2mm. Il cavo, praticamente indistruttibile. È un intreccio di tessuto anti-intreccio. Indistruttibile persino con una tronchese (lo spezzai per vedere all'interno a cuffia rotta). I colori sono i tipici della Jamaica che dopo un po si sbiadiscono ma non troppo.Il punto di giunzione cavo-cuffia è fatto benissimo. Non si leva mai anche se tirato molto forte (non esagerate sono pur sempre auricolari grandi poco più di un unghia).Qualità audio: superiore a molti paia di auricolari di questa fascia. A questo prezzo è imlossibile trovare auricolari così.Bassi ben presenti e gradevoli per chi come me ascolta molta house, techno e dance. All'orecchio risultano morbidi, ben definiti, lineari.Alti e medi ben presenti anche loro ma con meno presenza rispetto ai bassi. (Basta alzare di una tacchetta l'equalizzatore del cellulare per chi non ama per lo più i bassi).Al massimo del volume non distorgono nessuna delle frequenze citate sopra.Consiglio l'ascolto del genere ""madre"" di queste cuffie: il reggae.Le cuffie se ben trattate possono durare anche 2 anni (esperienza personale).

Love the design of these, and the way the earbuds are made from wood, it gives them a classy look that stands out from traditional earbuds. I like the cord as well, it does get twisted up from time to time but definitely doesn't tangle like regular earbuds. I've compared these to regular Apple earbuds that come with iPhones, as well as the AKG's that Samsung provides in the boxes that come with the S8 series and Note 8 and in my opinion they are superior. It's noticeable over the iPhone earbuds, and with the AKG's it provides a more solid base without being overbearing. I have small ears so the attachment that came with these earbuds was a good snug fit, but they also provide other attachments in case you want a different fit. It's important with these that you insert them deep enough into the ear to hear the thump of the base, you'll know if they're not in correctly. As far as noice cancellation these are fantastic...I had people talking to me when I first tried them out that were standing bedside me speaking at normal volume and I couldn't hear a thing.

It's a shade brighter than neutral. There can be the occasional sharp spike in the high-mids, but not bothersome.But it depends on the person's taste. If you like a warm/dark sounding IEM then these are probably not for you.The bass is tight and lean, it's not woofy or artificial. If you're a bass head then it's probably not going to be enough for you, but if you like ""accurate"" bass then you will like these. The rumble is there, but it takes more of a supportive role than a primary role.The soundstage is accurate. Not overly wide, not overly narrow. You get the punch in the middle while getting a good amount of width. The imaging is good, I can easily pick out where each instrument is coming from.The comfort okay, not bad, not great. I can't wear them for more than 1.5 hrs before I start to wanna take them off. But I've got stiff cartilage in my ears which makes them sensitive to pressure over time, so most ppl should be fine.They are more comfy than my previous Bluetooth IEMs though.I don't love the look of the cable but it's not a deal breaker. Seems to sound good.Build quality is great with the all metal shells. I have no fear of them breaking in my pocket.I'm surprised they are this cheap, they're really good. Don't get me wrong, they're not gonna wow you as much as some great headphones, but their Amazon rating should be higher than 4.4. I bought some Bluetooth earphones for around the same price a few years ago and these are twice as good. These are underrated.Easy to drive too. I have them playing through my phone.  "

You won't need any special audio equipment to make these sound good.I did try a few simple mods to see what could be done with these puppies and I was yet again impressed by one mod that I use on my letshuoer s12s. Instead of describing what I did, just search for ""letshuoer s12 micropore tape"" on YouTube. This gave me more bass and a wider sound stage. Well, to my ears it did, but it might be different for yours but the mod is worth a try :)You can't go wrong with these. Enjoy them!  "

With these you get a substantial improvement in build quality for that single step up the price ladder, with a nice metal shell that I find very comfortable to wear for prolonged periods (I find I enjoy putting them in when they're cold!) and decent quality braided cable. A lot has been written about how these sound, I'd just reiterate that they're on the brighter side than I'm used to, but not at all tiring, there is a richness and clarity with technical detail and a tight and precise bass response that I enjoy. This IEM journey has been a cautious one for me, I'm not ready to spend the sort of money I would on some decent open back headphones. But the Simgot EW200s represent excellent value for money in my opinion.  "

I'm just a casual listener but after trying this one, I can definitely say these are really good. The IEMs itself feel premium with its metal coating. It feels heavy in hand and the sound places the vocals in front of the instruments. The bass is decent, not too bass heavy but it's there. It just sounds great with general music listening (pop) and content watching. Gaming wise I feel like it's better if you get another IEM as the soundstage is not too wide in my opinion, so intricate sounds like footsteps is harder to pinpoint the exact direction. For the price, I thought it's a really good purchase for a daily earphone.  "

Es demasiado habitual encontrar auriculares en los que el anunciante promete una fantástica calidad de sonido, pero pocas veces ofrece la respuesta de frecuencias.La calidad de sonido siempre será una cuestión personal, pero este modelo da lo que promete de forma objetiva. Su respuesta de frecuencias, mostrada en gráfica, es congruente para unos auriculares intraurales, con la típica caída en la parte alta del espectro en este tipo de dispositivo, lo que otorga un sonido fiel a la grabación. Si alguien prefiere realces en graves, medios o agudos, siempre podrá acudir a una ecualización básica, pues la buena respuesta de frecuencia de estos auriculares permite cambios audibles con leves ajustes.Por otro lado el tacto de los auriculares muestra una excelente calidad de fabricación.No veo la necesidad de gastar más dinero para obtener mejor calidad de sonido en unos auriculares intraurales; ni tampoco una mejor estética, para quien sea sensible a las apariencias.

Dadurch, dass es keine krassen peaks oder dips gibt, ist er auch sehr einfach mit EQ zu verändern. In meinen Ohren sitzen die IEMs leider nicht sehr komfortabel, das wird aber wieder von der Person abhängen.  Was mir negativ am Klang aufgefallen ist, ist, dass er nicht sonderlich natürlich klingt und es sich manchmal so anhört, als würden die Instrumente nicht richtig zusammen funktionieren. Er klingt generell sehr trocken und weniger ""abgeschlossen"", was glaube ich mit der Geschwindigkeit des verwendeten Treibers zusammen hängt.  Die Stimme ist meistens nicht sonderlich fokussiert, sondern steht eher im ganzen Raum, wovon ich kein Fan bin.Damit sind wir beim Positiven: Der IEM ist enorm hochauflösend. So, wie ich es noch nie bei einem IEM gehört habe, inklusive vielen, die bis zu dem Zehnfachen kosten. Immer wenn ich mit anderen IEMs Künstler wie Bob Dylan oder Faber höre, habe ich das Gefühl die Textur auf der Stimme komme nicht richtig rüber, wenn man es mit einem HD600 vergleicht. Das ist natürlich nicht fair, und ich sage nicht, dass der ew200 ganz da ist, aber ich habe zumindest nie das Gefühl, dass ich etwas verpasse. Die Klarheit und Seperation der einzelnen Details ist auch wirklich enorm gut. Ich habe gestern eine Vorlesung mit dem HD600 geguckt und dann zu dem ew200 gewechselt und mir ist sofort ein ganz eindeutiger Hall im Raum aufgefallen, den ich vorher nicht gehört hatte. Der Bass ist ohne EQ sehr laut, ich habe ihn 7db runtergestellt, was theoretisch deutlich niedriger ist, als ich normalerweise höre, aber der ""punch"" ist so gut, dass mir das garnicht so vorkommt. Im vergleich zu etwas wie dem 7hz Timeless ist das wirklich Tag und Nacht. Da ist der Bass noch lauter, aber es gibt garkeinen richtigen impact. Sachen wie die Textur auf der Stimme kommen da auch so gut wie garnicht rüber. Generell ist Einzige, was der Timeless besser macht das aufgeräumt sein und die Kohärenz des Klangs. Könnte ich nur einen behalten, würde ich auf jeden Fall diesen nehmen. Wenn ihr von etwas, wie einem Truthear Hola kommt, ist die Auflösung eine komplett andere Welt, ich könnte mir sogar vorstellen, dass sie am Anfang überfordert.    "

It is astonishing you can get something that sounds this amazing for $39Up until now I have avoided IEM because of fitment issues. These are a nice size and quite comfortable. The silicone tips that came with them are not for me. I ordered a variety pack of foam tips and the large ones were just the ticket. I struggled until that point getting a good seal, and was somewhat disappointed with the low end. Once the proper tips for me were put on, now the seal is tight and sounds perfect on the bottom end.If you like a nice clean open sound, with crystal clear mids and highs, with a generally solid bottom end, these are great. The sub frequencies are present and accounted for, just don't slam like some people like.These are exceptionally easy to drive so no extra stuff is needed. a simple usb c dongle is fine.  "
