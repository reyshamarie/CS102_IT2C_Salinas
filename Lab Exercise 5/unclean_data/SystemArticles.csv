More specifically, lexicographic calculus is used to construct nonsmooth sensitivity rank condition (SERC) tests, which we call lexicographic SERC (L-SERC) tests. The introduced L-SERC tests are: (i) practically implementable and amenable to large-scale problems; (ii) accurate since they directly treat the nonsmoothness while avoiding, e.g., smoothing approximations; and (iii) analogous to (and indeed recover) their smooth counterparts. To accomplish this, a first-order Taylor-like approximation theory is developed using lexicographic differentiation to directly treat nonsmooth functions. A practically implementable algorithm is proposed that determines partial structural identifiability or observability, a useful characterization in the nonsmooth setting. Lastly, the theory is illustrated through an application in climate modeling.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 17:32:53 UTC (339 KB)"

The system consists of two mobile robots programmed for two scenarios: one where the robot remains stationary and another where it follows a predefined trajectory. Communication within the system is conducted through orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to mitigate the effects of multipath propagation in indoor environments. The system's performance is evaluated using the bit error rate (BER). Connections related to robot motion and communication are implemented using Raspberry Pi 3 and BladeRF x115, respectively. The least squares (LS) technique is employed to estimate the channel with a bit error rate of approximately 10^(-2).","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 16:44:53 UTC (14,853 KB)"

Ahmed, Calin Curescu","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)","Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) systems involve computationally intensive image processing algorithms that can burden end-devices with limited resources, leading to poor performance in providing low latency services. Edge-to-cloud computing overcomes the limitations of end-devices by offloading their computations to nearby edge devices or remote cloud servers. Although this proves to be sufficient for many applications, optimal placement of latency sensitive AR/VR services in edge-to-cloud infrastructures (to provide desirable service response times and reliability) remain a formidable challenging. To address this challenge, this paper develops a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) to optimize the placement of AR/VR-based services in multi-tier edge-to-cloud environments. The primary objective of the proposed MOGA is to minimize the response time of all running services, while maximizing the reliability of the underlying system from both software and hardware perspectives. To evaluate its performance, we mathematically modeled all components and developed a tailor-made simulator to assess its effectiveness on various scales. MOGA was compared with several heuristics to prove that intuitive solutions, which are usually assumed sufficient, are not efficient enough for the stated problem. The experimental results indicated that MOGA can significantly reduce the response time of deployed services by an average of 67\% on different scales, compared to other heuristic methods. MOGA also ensures reliability of the 97\% infrastructure (hardware) and 95\% services (software).","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 15:54:56 UTC (1,379 KB)"

Tests of the divertor multi-instrument Bayesian analysis system (D-MIBAS) on a synthetic data set (including realistic experimental uncertainties) generated from SOLPS-ITER predictions of the MAST-U divertor have been performed. The resulting inference was within 6\%, 5\% and 30\% median absolute percentage error of the SOLPS-predicted electron temperature, electron density and neutral atomic hydrogen density, respectively, across a two-dimensional poloidal cross-section of the MAST-U Super-X outer divertor.
To accommodate molecular contributions to Balmer emission, an advanced emission model has been developed which is shown to be crucial for inference accuracy. Our D-MIBAS system utilises a mesh aligned to poloidal magnetic flux-surfaces, throughout the divertor, with plasma parameters assigned to each mesh vertex and collectively considered in the inference. This allowed comprehensive forward models to multiple diagnostics and the inclusion of expected physics. This is shown to be important for inference precision when including molecular contributions to Balmer emission. These developments pave the way for accurate two-dimensional electron temperature, electron density and neutral atomic hydrogen density inferences for MAST-U divertor experimental data for the first time.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 15:18:03 UTC (3,585 KB)"

Vincent Poor","Information Theory (cs.IT)","Acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) at an access point (AP) is challenging for wideband millimeter wave (mmWave) ultra-massive multiple-input and multiple-output (UMMIMO) systems, due to the high-dimensional channel matrices, hybrid near- and far- field channel feature, beam squint effects, and imperfect hardware constraints, such as low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, and in-phase and quadrature imbalance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient downlink channel estimation (CE) and CSI feedback approach based on knowledge and data dual-driven deep learning (DL) networks. Specifically, we first propose a data-driven residual neural network de-quantizer (ResNet-DQ) to pre-process the received pilot signals at user equipment (UEs), where the noise and distortion brought by imperfect hardware can be mitigated. A knowledge-driven generalized multiple measurement vector learned approximate message passing (GMMV-LAMP) network is then developed to jointly estimate the channels by exploiting the approximately same physical angle shared by different subcarriers. In particular, two wideband redundant dictionaries (WRDs) are proposed such that the measurement matrices of the GMMV-LAMP network can accommodate the far-field and near-field beam squint effect, respectively. Finally, we propose an encoder at the UEs and a decoder at the AP by a data-driven CSI residual network (CSI-ResNet) to compress the CSI matrix into a low-dimensional quantized bit vector for feedback, thereby reducing the feedback overhead substantially. Simulation results show that the proposed knowledge and data dual-driven approach outperforms conventional downlink CE and CSI feedback methods, especially in the case of low signal-to-noise ratios.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 15:12:56 UTC (14,198 KB)"

Proudfoot, Dallin Spencer, Simon Porter, Will Grundy","Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)","Many details of the formation and evolution of the solar system are best inferred by understanding the orbital and physical properties of small bodies in the solar system. For example, small body binaries are particularly valuable for measuring masses. By extending the models of small body binaries beyond point masses, new information about the shape and spin orientation becomes available. This is particularly informative for Trans-Neptunian multiples (two or more components) where shapes and spin orientations are poorly understood. Going beyond point masses requires modeling tools that no longer assume fixed Keplerian orbits. To this end, we have developed a new n-quadrupole integrator SPINNY (SPIN+N-bodY) and pair it with a Bayesian parameter inference tool MultiMoon, both of which are publicly available. We describe these tools and how they can be used to learn more about solar system small body multiple systems. We then apply them to the unique Trans-Neptunian hierarchical triple system (47171) Lempo, finding a three-point-mass solution for the first time. This solution has two surprises: unequal densities of the inner components and a dynamical configuration apparently unstable on the age of the solar system.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 14:50:47 UTC (4,925 KB)"
"8","Large-Scale RIS Enabled Air-Ground Channels: Near-Field Modeling and Analysis","Hao Jiang, Wangqi Shi, Zaichen Zhang, Cunhua Pan, Qingqing Wu, Feng Shu, Ruiqi Liu, Jiangzhou Wang","Signal Processing (eess.SP)","Existing works mainly rely on the far-field planar-wave-based channel model to assess the performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enabled wireless communication systems. However, when the transmitter and receiver are in near-field ranges, this will result in relatively low computing accuracy. To tackle this challenge, we initially develop an analytical framework for sub-array partitioning. This framework divides the large-scale RIS array into multiple sub-arrays, effectively reducing modeling complexity while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Then, we develop a beam domain channel model based on the proposed sub-array partition framework for large-scale RIS-enabled UAV-to-vehicle communication systems, which can be used to efficiently capture the sparse features in RIS-enabled UAV-to-vehicle channels in both near-field and far-field ranges. Furthermore, some important propagation characteristics of the proposed channel model, including the spatial cross-correlation functions (CCFs), temporal auto-correlation functions (ACFs), frequency correlation functions (CFs), and channel capacities with respect to the different physical features of the RIS and non-stationary properties of the channel model are derived and analyzed. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed framework is helpful to achieve a good tradeoff between model complexity and accuracy for investigating the channel propagation characteristics, and therefore providing highly-efficient communications in RIS-enabled UAV-to-vehicle wireless networks.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 14:48:10 UTC (1,183 KB)"

The deformation-curl decomposition developed by the second author and his collaborator is utilized to effectively decouple the elliptic-hyperbolic mixed structure in the steady compressible Euler equation. A key parameter in the helical symmetry is the step (denoted by $\sigma$), which denotes the magnitude of the translation along the symmetry axis after rotating one full turn. It is shown that the step determines the type of the first order partial differential system satisfied by the radial and vertical velocity. There exists a critical number $\sigma_{*}$ depending only on the background transonic flows, such that if $0<\sigma<\sigma_{*}$, one can prove the existence and uniqueness of smooth helically symmetric transonic flows with nonzero vorticity.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 14:29:57 UTC (14 KB)"

This work proposes a novel continuous-time control-theoretic framework for equality-constrained optimization. The key idea is to design a feedback control system where the Lagrange multipliers are the control input, and the output represents the constraints. The system converges to a stationary point of the constrained optimization problem through suitable regulation. Regarding the Lagrange multipliers, we consider two control laws: proportional-integral control and feedback linearization. These choices give rise to a family of different methods. We rigorously develop the related algorithms, theoretically analyze their convergence and present several numerical experiments to support their effectiveness concerning the state-of-the-art approaches.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 13:54:34 UTC (455 KB)"
"12","Small Distance Increment Method for Measuring Complex Permittivity With mmWave Radar","Hang Song, Hyun Joon Kim, Mingxia Wan, Bo Wei, Takamaro Kikkawa, Jun-ichi Takada","Signal Processing (eess.SP)","Measuring the complex permittivity of material is essential in many scenarios such as quality check and component analysis. Generally, measurement methods for characterizing the material are based on the usage of vector network analyzer, which is large and not easy for on-site measurement, especially in high frequency range such as millimeter wave (mmWave). In addition, some measurement methods require the destruction of samples, which is not suitable for non-destructive inspection. In this work, a small distance increment (SDI) method is proposed to non-destructively measure the complex permittivity of material. In SDI, the transmitter and receiver are formed as the monostatic radar, which is facing towards the material under test (MUT). During the measurement, the distance between radar and MUT changes with small increments and the signals are recorded at each position. A mathematical model is formulated to depict the relationship among the complex permittivity, distance increment, and measured signals. By fitting the model, the complex permittivity of MUT is estimated. To implement and evaluate the proposed SDI method, a commercial off-the-shelf mmWave radar is utilized and the measurement system is developed. Then, the evaluation was carried out on the acrylic plate. With the proposed method, the estimated complex permittivity of acrylic plate shows good agreement with the literature values, demonstrating the efficacy of SDI method for characterizing the complex permittivity of material.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 13:42:16 UTC (980 KB)"

Crash triaging and severity estimation are important steps to ensure that the most critical vulnerabilities are addressed promptly. Furthermore, the proposed pipeline is integrated in GitLab CI. To identify the most vulnerable parts of the machine learning frameworks, we analyze their potential attack surfaces and develop fuzz targets for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and related projects such as h5py.

The technique combines interferometric measurements, acquired with a special setup, and sophisticated mathematical evaluation procedures. To determine the form of the surface under test, a computational model is required that closely mimics the measurement process of the physical measurement instruments. The parameters of the computational model, comprising the surface under test sought, are then tuned by solving an inverse problem. Due to this embedded structure of the real experiment and computational model and the overall complexity, a thorough uncertainty evaluation is challenging. In this work, a Bayesian approach is proposed to tackle the inverse problem, based on a statistical model derived from the computational model of the tilted-wave interferometer. Such a procedure naturally allows for uncertainty quantification to be made. We present an approximate inference scheme to efficiently sample quantities of the posterior using Monte Carlo sampling involving the statistical model. In particular, the methodology derived is applied to the tilted-wave interferometer to obtain an estimate and corresponding uncertainty of the pixel-by-pixel form of the surface under test for two typical surfaces taking into account a number of key influencing factors. A statistical analysis using experimental design is employed to identify main influencing factors and a subsequent analysis confirms the efficacy of the method derived.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 13:25:59 UTC (3,802 KB)"

While hardware accelerators and renewable energy have been utilized to enhance sustainability, addressing Quality of Service (QoS) degradation caused by renewable energy supply and hardware recycling remains challenging: (1) prior accelerators exhibit significant carbon footprints due to limited reconfigurability and inability to adapt to renewable energy fluctuations; (2) integrating recycled NAND flash chips in data centers poses challenges due to their short lifetime, increasing energy consumption; (3) the absence of a sustainability estimator impedes data centers and users in evaluating and improving their environmental impact. This study aims to improve system support for environmentally sustainable data centers by proposing a reconfigurable hardware accelerator for intensive computing primitives and developing a fractional NAND flash cell to extend the lifetime of recycled flash chips while supporting graceful capacity degradation. We also introduce a sustainability estimator to evaluate user task energy consumption and promote sustainable practices.

While pre-training offers clear advantages for downstream learning, it also endows downstream models with shared adversarial vulnerabilities that can be easily identified through the open-sourced foundation model. In this work, we expose such vulnerabilities in CLIP's downstream models and show that foundation models can serve as a basis for attacking their downstream systems. In particular, we propose a simple yet effective adversarial attack strategy termed Patch Representation Misalignment (PRM). Solely based on open-sourced CLIP vision encoders, this method produces adversaries that simultaneously fool more than 20 downstream models spanning 4 common vision-language tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image captioning and visual question-answering). Our findings highlight the concerning safety risks introduced by the extensive usage of public foundational models in the development of downstream systems, calling for extra caution in these scenarios.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 12:51:39 UTC (45,305 KB)"

However, beyond rigid grasping and re-grasping, in-hand following is also an essential skill that humans use to dexterously manipulate DLOs, which requires continuously changing the grasp point by in-hand sliding while holding the DLO to prevent it from falling. Achieving such a skill is very challenging for robots without using specially designed but not versatile end-effectors. Previous works have attempted using generic parallel grippers, but their robustness is unsatisfactory owing to the conflict between following and holding, which is hard to balance with a one-degree-of-freedom gripper. In this work, inspired by how humans use fingers to follow DLOs, we explore the usage of a generic dexterous hand with tactile sensing to imitate human skills and achieve robust in-hand DLO following. To enable the hardware system to function in the real world, we develop a framework that includes Cartesian-space arm-hand control, tactile-based in-hand 3-D DLO pose estimation, and task-specific motion design. Experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of our method over using parallel grippers, as well as its great robustness, generalizability, and efficiency.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 12:21:23 UTC (1,348 KB)"

We demonstrate that the dynamics is enslaved to bonding, giving rise to an activated behaviour at low temperature. By independently computing the diffusion constant and the viscosity from the simulations, we also confirm the validity of the Stokes-Einstein relation in valence-limited systems, with two caveats: (i) the diffusion constant requires a finite-size correction, at least at the intermediate density we investigate, and (ii) there is the onset of a breakdown that appears at the lowest temperatures considered. Finally, our results show that the storage and loss moduli of mixtures of divalent and $M$-valent particles exhibit an apparent power-law dependence on frequency, hinting at the possibility of using the composition to finely tune the rheological response of these materials. Our results compare well with literature experimental data on valence-limited DNA nanostars. In addition, the wealth of data we present and analyse here will help to develop and test theoretical frameworks aimed at describing the dynamics of flexible limited-valence particles that self-assemble into disordered networks.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 12:00:42 UTC (325 KB)"

Higher order problems are very novel in the Calculus of Variations in $\mathrm L^{\infty}$, and exhibit a strikingly different behaviour compared to first order problems, for which there exists an established theory, pioneered by Aronsson in 1960s. The aim of this paper is to develop a complete theory for $\mathrm F_\infty$. We prove that, under appropriate conditions, ``localised"" minimisers can be characterised as solutions to a nonlinear system of PDEs, which is different from the corresponding Aronsson equation for $\mathrm F_\infty$; the latter is only a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for minimality. We also establish the existence and uniqueness of localised minimisers subject to Dirichlet conditions on $\partial \Omega$, and also their partial regularity outside a singular set of codimension one, which may be non-empty even if $n=1$.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 10:52:12 UTC (43 KB)"

Due to the substantial number of antennas, the electromagnetic radiation field is modeled by the spherical waves instead of the conventional planar waves, leading to severe weak sparsity to angular-domain near-field channel. Therefore, the channel estimation reminiscent of the conventional compression sensing (CS) approaches in the angular domain, judiciously utilized for low pilot overhead, may result in unprecedented challenges. To this end, this paper proposes a brand-new near-field channel estimation scheme by exploiting the naturally occurring useful side information. Specifically, we formulate the dual-band near-field communication model based on the fact that high-frequency systems are likely to be deployed with lower-frequency systems. Representative side information, i.e., the structural characteristic information derived by the sparsity ambiguity and the out-of-band spatial information stemming from the lower-frequency channel, is explored and tailored to materialize exceptional near-field channel estimation. Furthermore, in-depth theoretical analyses are developed to guarantee the minimum estimation error, based on which a suite of algorithms leveraging the elaborating side information are proposed. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the designed algorithms provide more assured results than the off-the-shelf approaches in the context of the dual-band near-field communications in both on- and off-grid scenarios, where the angle of departures/arrivals are discretely or continuously distributed, respectively.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 10:40:18 UTC (7,668 KB)"

Within the gradually improving global communication, the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system based on optical fibers can accomplish various functionalities, such as urban structure imaging, seismic wave detection, and pipeline safety monitoring. With the development of quantum communication, quantum networks based on optical fiber are gradually being established. In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and quantum network (ISAQN) scheme, which can achieve secure key distribution among multiple nodes and distributed sensing under the standard quantum limit. CV-QKD protocol and the round-trip multi-band structure are adopted to achieve the multi-node secure key distribution. Meanwhile, the spectrum phase monitoring (SPM) protocol is proposed to realize distributed sensing. It determines which node is vibrating by monitoring the frequency spectrum and restores the vibration waveform by monitoring the phase change. The scheme is experimentally demonstrated by simulating the vibration in a star structure network. Experimental results indicate that this multi-user quantum network can achieve a secret key rate (SKR) of approximately 0.7 $\rm{Mbits/s}$ for each user under 10 $\rm{km}$ standard fiber transmission and its network capacity is 8. In terms of distributed sensing, it can achieve a vibration response bandwidth ranging from 1 $\rm{Hz}$ to 2 $\rm{kHz}$, a strain resolution of 0.50 $\rm{n}$$\varepsilon$$/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$, and a spatial resolution of 0.20 $\rm{m}$ under shot-noise-limited detection.

In sharp contrast to existing results, the dynamics of flexible spacecraft systems and external disturbances are allowed to be unknown. To deal with the challenges by these unknown factors, we develop a class of nonlinear internal models which converts the attitude tracking problem of uncertain flexible spacecraft systems into a regulation problem of an augmented system. Furthermore, to overcome the difficulties caused by the unmeasurable modal variable, the uncertainty introduced by the internal model, and the cross-coupling of the uncertainties with the system state, we design an auxiliary dynamic system for auxiliary stabilization, a dynamic compensator for dynamic compensation, and a linearly parameterized transformation for adaptive regulation in sequence. By introducing a series of coordinate and input transformations, we propose an adaptive dynamic control law to achieve regulation of the augmented system and thus leading to the solution to the attitude tracking problem. In addition, we analyze the convergence issue of the estimated parameter to its true value by the persistently exciting condition. Finally, the effec tiveness of the developed approach is verified by its application to the attitude manoeuvre of a flexible spacecraft system in the presence of external disturbances.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 08:37:57 UTC (443 KB)"

An integrated human sensing strategy based on a hierarchically connected tree structure is proposed to fuse localized visual information. Constituting the tree model are the nodes representing keypoints and the edges representing keyparts, which are consistently interconnected to preserve the structural constraints during multi-source fusion. Utilizing RGB-D data and HRNet, the 3D positions of keypoints are analytically estimated, and their presence is inferred through a sliding widow of confidence scores. Subsequently, the point clouds of reliable keyparts are extracted by drawing occlusion-resistant masks, enabling fine registration between data clouds and cylindrical model following the hierarchical order. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances keypart recognition recall from 69.20% to 90.10%, compared to employing a single static camera. Furthermore, in overcoming challenges related to localized and occluded perception, the robotic arm's obstacle avoidance capabilities are effectively improved.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 08:25:42 UTC (28,605 KB)"

To this end, we first propose a Gaussian densification strategy based on the rendering loss to map unobserved areas and refine reobserved areas. Second, we introduce extra regularization parameters to alleviate the forgetting problem in the continuous mapping problem, where parameters tend to overfit the latest frame and result in decreasing rendering quality for previous frames. Both mapping and tracking are performed with Gaussian parameters by minimizing re-rendering loss in a differentiable way.

The occurrence of multiple faults can significantly impact system accuracy and service life. The vibration signal of the gearbox is an effective indicator of its operational status and fault information. However, gearboxes in real industrial settings often operate under variable working conditions, such as varying speeds and loads. It is a significant and challenging research area to complete the gearbox fault diagnosis procedure under varying operating conditions using vibration signals. This data article presents vibration datasets collected from a gearbox exhibiting various fault degrees of severity and fault types, operating under diverse speed and load conditions. These faults are manually implanted into the gears or bearings through precise machining processes, which include health, missing teeth, wear, pitting, root cracks, and broken teeth. Several kinds of actual compound faults are also encompassed. The development of these datasets facilitates testing the effectiveness and reliability of newly developed fault diagnosis methods.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 07:44:18 UTC (3,114 KB)"

Solving the corresponding Schrödinger equations can interpret or predict experimental spectra of molecules. In this study, we develop a novel approach to solve excited states of anharmonic vibrational systems. The normal coordinates of molecules are transformed into new coordinates through a normalizing flow parameterized by a neural network, facilitating the construction of a set of orthogonal many-body variational wavefunctions. Our methodology has been validated on an exactly solvable $64$-dimensional coupled harmonic oscillator, yielding numerical results with a relative error on the order of $10^{-6}$. Furthermore, the neural canonical transformations are also applied to calculate the energy levels of two specific molecules, acetonitrile ($\text{C}\text{H}_3\text{CN}$) and ethylene oxide ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4\text{O}$) involving $12$ and $15$ vibrational modes respectively, which are in agreement with experimental findings. One of the key advantages of our approach is its flexibility concerning the potential energy surface, requiring no specific form for its application. Moreover, this method can be easily implemented on large-scale distributed computing platforms, making it particularly suitable for investigating more complex vibrational structures.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 07:41:37 UTC (266 KB)"

Recent advances in literature have studied the network representations of deep neural networks. However, there has been little work that studies representations learned by SNNs, especially using unsupervised local learning methods like spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Recent work by \cite{barannikov2021representation} has introduced a novel method to compare topological mappings of learned representations called Representation Topology Divergence (RTD). Though useful, this method is engineered particularly for feedforward deep neural networks and cannot be used for recurrent networks like Recurrent SNNs (RSNNs). This paper introduces a novel methodology to use RTD to measure the difference between distributed representations of RSNN models with different learning methods. We propose a novel reformulation of RSNNs using feedforward autoencoder networks with skip connections to help us compute the RTD for recurrent networks. Thus, we investigate the learning capabilities of RSNN trained using STDP and the role of heterogeneity in the synaptic dynamics in learning such representations. We demonstrate that heterogeneous STDP in RSNNs yield distinct representations than their homogeneous and surrogate gradient-based supervised learning counterparts. Our results provide insights into the potential of heterogeneous SNN models, aiding the development of more efficient and biologically plausible hybrid artificial intelligence systems.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 05:37:26 UTC (5,327 KB)"

However, such systems are often not designed to be transparent about their limitations; a user may easily prompt a model with an instruction without any idea of whether the responses should be expected to be accurate, or if the system is even capable of performing the task. We propose a third party performance prediction framework, where a separate model is trained to predict the metric resulting from evaluating an instruction-following system on a task while assuming access only to its inputs and outputs at inference time. We perform this analysis with a variety of both open and closed instruction-following models as well as multiple performance predictors, and examine the effect of various factors such as model size, number of training tasks, and prompt format.

However, it is difficult for current techniques to display smooth animations using 8-bit images and to adjust display resolution, similar to conventional displays. We present ProgrammableGrass, an artificial grass display with scalable resolution, capable of swiftly controlling grass color at 8-bit levels. This grass display can control grass colors linearly at the 8-bit level, similar to an LCD display, and can also display not only 8-bit-based images but also videos. This display enables pixel-by-pixel color transitions from yellow to green using fixed-length yellow and adjustable-length green grass. We designed a grass module that can be connected to other modules. Utilizing a proportional derivative control, the grass colors are manipulated to display animations at approximately 10 [fps]. Since the relationship between grass lengths and colors is nonlinear, we developed a calibration system for ProgrammableGrass. We revealed that this calibration system allows ProgrammableGrass to linearly control grass colors at 8-bit levels through experiments under multiple conditions. Lastly, we demonstrate ProgrammableGrass to show smooth animations with 8-bit grayscale images. Moreover, we show several application examples to illustrate the potential of ProgrammableGrass.

Generally, preparing a target entangled state via unitary evolution with time-dependent couplings is a challenging task and very little is known about the existence of solutions and their properties. In this work we develop a constructive approach for preparing matrix product states (MPS) via continuous unitary evolution. We provide an explicit construction of the operator which exactly implements the evolution of a given MPS along a specified direction in its tangent space. This operator can be written as a sum of local terms of finite range, yet it is in general non-Hermitian. Relying on the explicit construction of the non-Hermitian generator of the dynamics, we demonstrate the existence of a Hermitian sequence of operators that implements the desired MPS evolution with the error which decreases exponentially with the operator range. The construction is benchmarked on an explicit periodic trajectory in a translationally invariant MPS manifold. We demonstrate that the Floquet unitary generating the dynamics over one period of the trajectory features an approximate MPS-like eigenstate embedded among a sea of thermalizing eigenstates. These results show that our construction is useful not only for state preparation and control of many-body systems, but also provides a generic route towards Floquet scars -- periodically driven models with quasi-local generators of dynamics that have exact MPS eigenstates in their spectrum.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 23:34:19 UTC (2,050 KB)"

Netz","Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)","On the microscopic level, biological signal transmission relies on coordinated structural changes in allosteric proteins that involve sensor and effector modules. The timescales and microscopic details of signal transmission in proteins are often unclear, despite a plethora of structural information on signaling proteins. Based on linear-response theory, we develop a theoretical framework to define frequency-dependent force and displacement transmit functions through proteins and, more generally, viscoelastic media. Transmit functions quantify the fraction of a local time-dependent perturbation at one site, be it a deformation, a force, or a combination thereof, that survives at a second site. They are defined in terms of equilibrium fluctuations from simulations or experimental observations. We apply the framework to our all-atom molecular dynamics simulation data of a parallel, homodimeric coiled-coil (CC) motif that connects sensor and effector modules of a blue-light-regulated histidine kinase from bacterial signaling systems extensively studied in experiments. Our analysis reveals that signal transmission through the CC is possible via shift, splay, and twist deformation modes. Based on the results of mutation experiments, we infer that the most relevant mode for the biological function of the histidine kinase protein is the splay deformation.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 23:19:33 UTC (7,488 KB)"

Li","Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)","Developing theoretical frameworks for vibrational strong coupling (VSC) beyond the single-mode approximation is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of experiments with planar Fabry-Pérot cavities. Herein, a generalized cavity molecular dynamics (CavMD) scheme is developed to simulate VSC of a large ensemble of realistic molecules coupled to an arbitrary 1D or 2D photonic environment. This approach is built upon the Power-Zienau-Woolley Hamiltonian in the normal mode basis and uses a grid representation of the molecular ensembles to reduce the computational cost. When simulating the polariton dispersion relation for a homogeneous distribution of molecules in planar Fabry-Pérot cavities, our data highlight the importance of preserving the in-plane translational symmetry of the molecular distribution. In this homogeneous limit, CavMD yields the consistent polariton dispersion relation as analytic theory, i.e., incorporating many cavity modes with varying in-plane wave vectors ($k_{\parallel}$) produces the same spectrum as the system with a single cavity mode. Furthermore, CavMD reveals that the validity of the single mode approximation is challenged when nonequilibrium polariton dynamics are considered, as polariton-polariton scattering occurs between modes with nearest neighbor $k_{\parallel}$. Looking forward, our generalized CavMD approach may facilitate understanding vibrational polariton transport and condensation.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 22:02:38 UTC (2,836 KB)"

Such CI/CD configurations and services require synchronization during the life cycle of the projects. Several works discussed how CI/CD configuration and services change during their usage in traditional software systems. However, there is very limited knowledge of how CI/CD configuration and services change in ML projects.
To fill this knowledge gap, this work presents the first empirical analysis of how CI/CD configuration evolves for ML software systems. We manually analyzed 343 commits collected from 508 open-source ML projects to identify common CI/CD configuration change categories in ML projects and devised a taxonomy of 14 co-changes in CI/CD and ML components. Moreover, we developed a CI/CD configuration change clustering tool that identified frequent CI/CD configuration change patterns in 15,634 commits. Furthermore, we measured the expertise of ML developers who modify CI/CD configurations. Based on this analysis, we found that 61.8% of commits include a change to the build policy and minimal changes related to performance and maintainability compared to general open-source projects. Additionally, the co-evolution analysis identified that CI/CD configurations, in many cases, changed unnecessarily due to bad practices such as the direct inclusion of dependencies and a lack of usage of standardized testing frameworks. More practices were found through the change patterns analysis consisting of using deprecated settings and reliance on a generic build language. Finally, our developer's expertise analysis suggests that experienced developers are more inclined to modify CI/CD configurations.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 19:14:38 UTC (2,359 KB)"

We use the simplest model of two neutrino beams initially of different flavor that either suddenly appear or one or both slowly build up. Flavor conversions commence well before the putative unstable state is fully attained, and the final outcome depends on how the system is driven. Our results suggest that in an astrophysical setting, one should focus less on flavor instabilities in the neutrino radiation field and more on the external dynamics that leads to the formation of the unstable state.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 19:00:02 UTC (385 KB)"

The chambers in front of the magnetic field, closest to the interaction point, have developed significant self-sustained currents and discharges during operation, most probably triggered by isobutane-based gas mixtures. Only both, (i) replacing isobutane by CO2 and (ii) adding 1000 to 3500 ppmv of water into the Ar/CO2 counting gas mixture, individually optimized for a given chamber, allowed to recover the chambers, enabling stable operation in several production runs since then, e.g. with high-intensity heavy-ion induced reactions. The origin of the instability was found to be deposits on the cathode wires, provoking the Malter-like effects, by visual inspection and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The charge on the wires accumulated during their lifetime does not point to so-called classical aging, but presumably the interaction of isobutane with materials in the gas flow, residual impurities, and reaction products formed in plasma, e.g., built by discharges.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 18:50:28 UTC (2,384 KB)"

The RSVT prior is developed based on two key observations regarding the relationship between hazy and haze-free points in the HSV color space. First, the hue component shows marginal variation between corresponding hazy and haze-free points, consolidating a hypothesis that the pixel value variability induced by haze primarily occurs in the saturation and value spaces. Second, in the 2D saturation-value coordinate system, most lines passing through hazy-clean point pairs are likely to intersect near the atmospheric light coordinates. Accordingly, haze removal for the bright regions can be performed by properly translating saturation-value coordinates. In addition, an effective soft segmentation method based on a morphological min-max channel is introduced. By combining the soft segmentation mask with the RSVT prior, a comprehensive single image dehazing framework is devised. Experimental results on various synthetic and realistic hazy image datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme successfully addresses color distortion issues and restores visually appealing images.

Losey","Robotics (cs.RO)","Assistive robot arms can help humans by partially automating their desired tasks. Consider an adult with motor impairments controlling an assistive robot arm to eat dinner. The robot can reduce the number of human inputs -- and how precise those inputs need to be -- by recognizing what the human wants (e.g., a fork) and assisting for that task (e.g., moving towards the fork). Prior research has largely focused on learning the human's task and providing meaningful assistance. But as the robot learns and assists, we also need to ensure that the human understands the robot's intent (e.g., does the human know the robot is reaching for a fork?). In this paper, we study the effects of communicating learned assistance from the robot back to the human operator. We do not focus on the specific interfaces used for communication. Instead, we develop experimental and theoretical models of a) how communication changes the way humans interact with assistive robot arms, and b) how robots can harness these changes to better align with the human's intent. We first conduct online and in-person user studies where participants operate robots that provide partial assistance, and we measure how the human's inputs change with and without communication. With communication, we find that humans are more likely to intervene when the robot incorrectly predicts their intent, and more likely to release control when the robot correctly understands their task. We then use these findings to modify an established robot learning algorithm so that the robot can correctly interpret the human's inputs when communication is present. Our results from a second in-person user study suggest that this combination of communication and learning outperforms assistive systems that isolate either learning or communication.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 17:55:52 UTC (2,280 KB)"

More specifically, lexicographic calculus is used to construct nonsmooth sensitivity rank condition (SERC) tests, which we call lexicographic SERC (L-SERC) tests. The introduced L-SERC tests are: (i) practically implementable and amenable to large-scale problems; (ii) accurate since they directly treat the nonsmoothness while avoiding, e.g., smoothing approximations; and (iii) analogous to (and indeed recover) their smooth counterparts. To accomplish this, a first-order Taylor-like approximation theory is developed using lexicographic differentiation to directly treat nonsmooth functions. A practically implementable algorithm is proposed that determines partial structural identifiability or observability, a useful characterization in the nonsmooth setting. Lastly, the theory is illustrated through an application in climate modeling.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 17:32:53 UTC (339 KB)"

Ahmed, Calin Curescu","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)","Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) systems involve computationally intensive image processing algorithms that can burden end-devices with limited resources, leading to poor performance in providing low latency services. Edge-to-cloud computing overcomes the limitations of end-devices by offloading their computations to nearby edge devices or remote cloud servers. Although this proves to be sufficient for many applications, optimal placement of latency sensitive AR/VR services in edge-to-cloud infrastructures (to provide desirable service response times and reliability) remain a formidable challenging. To address this challenge, this paper develops a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) to optimize the placement of AR/VR-based services in multi-tier edge-to-cloud environments. The primary objective of the proposed MOGA is to minimize the response time of all running services, while maximizing the reliability of the underlying system from both software and hardware perspectives. To evaluate its performance, we mathematically modeled all components and developed a tailor-made simulator to assess its effectiveness on various scales. MOGA was compared with several heuristics to prove that intuitive solutions, which are usually assumed sufficient, are not efficient enough for the stated problem. The experimental results indicated that MOGA can significantly reduce the response time of deployed services by an average of 67\% on different scales, compared to other heuristic methods. MOGA also ensures reliability of the 97\% infrastructure (hardware) and 95\% services (software).","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 15:54:56 UTC (1,379 KB)"

Tests of the divertor multi-instrument Bayesian analysis system (D-MIBAS) on a synthetic data set (including realistic experimental uncertainties) generated from SOLPS-ITER predictions of the MAST-U divertor have been performed. The resulting inference was within 6\%, 5\% and 30\% median absolute percentage error of the SOLPS-predicted electron temperature, electron density and neutral atomic hydrogen density, respectively, across a two-dimensional poloidal cross-section of the MAST-U Super-X outer divertor.
To accommodate molecular contributions to Balmer emission, an advanced emission model has been developed which is shown to be crucial for inference accuracy. Our D-MIBAS system utilises a mesh aligned to poloidal magnetic flux-surfaces, throughout the divertor, with plasma parameters assigned to each mesh vertex and collectively considered in the inference. This allowed comprehensive forward models to multiple diagnostics and the inclusion of expected physics. This is shown to be important for inference precision when including molecular contributions to Balmer emission. These developments pave the way for accurate two-dimensional electron temperature, electron density and neutral atomic hydrogen density inferences for MAST-U divertor experimental data for the first time.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 15:18:03 UTC (3,585 KB)"

Vincent Poor","Information Theory (cs.IT)","Acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) at an access point (AP) is challenging for wideband millimeter wave (mmWave) ultra-massive multiple-input and multiple-output (UMMIMO) systems, due to the high-dimensional channel matrices, hybrid near- and far- field channel feature, beam squint effects, and imperfect hardware constraints, such as low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, and in-phase and quadrature imbalance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient downlink channel estimation (CE) and CSI feedback approach based on knowledge and data dual-driven deep learning (DL) networks. Specifically, we first propose a data-driven residual neural network de-quantizer (ResNet-DQ) to pre-process the received pilot signals at user equipment (UEs), where the noise and distortion brought by imperfect hardware can be mitigated. A knowledge-driven generalized multiple measurement vector learned approximate message passing (GMMV-LAMP) network is then developed to jointly estimate the channels by exploiting the approximately same physical angle shared by different subcarriers. In particular, two wideband redundant dictionaries (WRDs) are proposed such that the measurement matrices of the GMMV-LAMP network can accommodate the far-field and near-field beam squint effect, respectively. Finally, we propose an encoder at the UEs and a decoder at the AP by a data-driven CSI residual network (CSI-ResNet) to compress the CSI matrix into a low-dimensional quantized bit vector for feedback, thereby reducing the feedback overhead substantially. Simulation results show that the proposed knowledge and data dual-driven approach outperforms conventional downlink CE and CSI feedback methods, especially in the case of low signal-to-noise ratios.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 15:12:56 UTC (14,198 KB)"

For example, small body binaries are particularly valuable for measuring masses. By extending the models of small body binaries beyond point masses, new information about the shape and spin orientation becomes available. This is particularly informative for Trans-Neptunian multiples (two or more components) where shapes and spin orientations are poorly understood. Going beyond point masses requires modeling tools that no longer assume fixed Keplerian orbits. To this end, we have developed a new n-quadrupole integrator SPINNY (SPIN+N-bodY) and pair it with a Bayesian parameter inference tool MultiMoon, both of which are publicly available. We describe these tools and how they can be used to learn more about solar system small body multiple systems.

However, when the transmitter and receiver are in near-field ranges, this will result in relatively low computing accuracy. To tackle this challenge, we initially develop an analytical framework for sub-array partitioning. This framework divides the large-scale RIS array into multiple sub-arrays, effectively reducing modeling complexity while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Then, we develop a beam domain channel model based on the proposed sub-array partition framework for large-scale RIS-enabled UAV-to-vehicle communication systems, which can be used to efficiently capture the sparse features in RIS-enabled UAV-to-vehicle channels in both near-field and far-field ranges. Furthermore, some important propagation characteristics of the proposed channel model, including the spatial cross-correlation functions (CCFs), temporal auto-correlation functions (ACFs), frequency correlation functions (CFs), and channel capacities with respect to the different physical features of the RIS and non-stationary properties of the channel model are derived and analyzed. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed framework is helpful to achieve a good tradeoff between model complexity and accuracy for investigating the channel propagation characteristics, and therefore providing highly-efficient communications in RIS-enabled UAV-to-vehicle wireless networks.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 14:48:10 UTC (1,183 KB)"

The deformation-curl decomposition developed by the second author and his collaborator is utilized to effectively decouple the elliptic-hyperbolic mixed structure in the steady compressible Euler equation. A key parameter in the helical symmetry is the step (denoted by $\sigma$), which denotes the magnitude of the translation along the symmetry axis after rotating one full turn. It is shown that the step determines the type of the first order partial differential system satisfied by the radial and vertical velocity. There exists a critical number $\sigma_{*}$ depending only on the background transonic flows, such that if $0<\sigma<\sigma_{*}$, one can prove the existence and uniqueness of smooth helically symmetric transonic flows with nonzero vorticity.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 14:29:57 UTC (14 KB)"

Generally, measurement methods for characterizing the material are based on the usage of vector network analyzer, which is large and not easy for on-site measurement, especially in high frequency range such as millimeter wave (mmWave). In addition, some measurement methods require the destruction of samples, which is not suitable for non-destructive inspection. In this work, a small distance increment (SDI) method is proposed to non-destructively measure the complex permittivity of material. In SDI, the transmitter and receiver are formed as the monostatic radar, which is facing towards the material under test (MUT). During the measurement, the distance between radar and MUT changes with small increments and the signals are recorded at each position. A mathematical model is formulated to depict the relationship among the complex permittivity, distance increment, and measured signals. By fitting the model, the complex permittivity of MUT is estimated. To implement and evaluate the proposed SDI method, a commercial off-the-shelf mmWave radar is utilized and the measurement system is developed. Then, the evaluation was carried out on the acrylic plate. With the proposed method, the estimated complex permittivity of acrylic plate shows good agreement with the literature values, demonstrating the efficacy of SDI method for characterizing the complex permittivity of material.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 13:42:16 UTC (980 KB)"

The technique combines interferometric measurements, acquired with a special setup, and sophisticated mathematical evaluation procedures. To determine the form of the surface under test, a computational model is required that closely mimics the measurement process of the physical measurement instruments. The parameters of the computational model, comprising the surface under test sought, are then tuned by solving an inverse problem. Due to this embedded structure of the real experiment and computational model and the overall complexity, a thorough uncertainty evaluation is challenging. In this work, a Bayesian approach is proposed to tackle the inverse problem, based on a statistical model derived from the computational model of the tilted-wave interferometer. Such a procedure naturally allows for uncertainty quantification to be made. We present an approximate inference scheme to efficiently sample quantities of the posterior using Monte Carlo sampling involving the statistical model. In particular, the methodology derived is applied to the tilted-wave interferometer to obtain an estimate and corresponding uncertainty of the pixel-by-pixel form of the surface under test for two typical surfaces taking into account a number of key influencing factors. A statistical analysis using experimental design is employed to identify main influencing factors and a subsequent analysis confirms the efficacy of the method derived.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 13:25:59 UTC (3,802 KB)"

In this work, we expose such vulnerabilities in CLIP's downstream models and show that foundation models can serve as a basis for attacking their downstream systems. In particular, we propose a simple yet effective adversarial attack strategy termed Patch Representation Misalignment (PRM).

However, beyond rigid grasping and re-grasping, in-hand following is also an essential skill that humans use to dexterously manipulate DLOs, which requires continuously changing the grasp point by in-hand sliding while holding the DLO to prevent it from falling. Achieving such a skill is very challenging for robots without using specially designed but not versatile end-effectors. Previous works have attempted using generic parallel grippers, but their robustness is unsatisfactory owing to the conflict between following and holding, which is hard to balance with a one-degree-of-freedom gripper. In this work, inspired by how humans use fingers to follow DLOs, we explore the usage of a generic dexterous hand with tactile sensing to imitate human skills and achieve robust in-hand DLO following. To enable the hardware system to function in the real world, we develop a framework that includes Cartesian-space arm-hand control, tactile-based in-hand 3-D DLO pose estimation, and task-specific motion design.

Finally, our results show that the storage and loss moduli of mixtures of divalent and $M$-valent particles exhibit an apparent power-law dependence on frequency, hinting at the possibility of using the composition to finely tune the rheological response of these materials. Our results compare well with literature experimental data on valence-limited DNA nanostars.

Due to the substantial number of antennas, the electromagnetic radiation field is modeled by the spherical waves instead of the conventional planar waves, leading to severe weak sparsity to angular-domain near-field channel. Therefore, the channel estimation reminiscent of the conventional compression sensing (CS) approaches in the angular domain, judiciously utilized for low pilot overhead, may result in unprecedented challenges. To this end, this paper proposes a brand-new near-field channel estimation scheme by exploiting the naturally occurring useful side information. Specifically, we formulate the dual-band near-field communication model based on the fact that high-frequency systems are likely to be deployed with lower-frequency systems. Representative side information, i.e., the structural characteristic information derived by the sparsity ambiguity and the out-of-band spatial information stemming from the lower-frequency channel, is explored and tailored to materialize exceptional near-field channel estimation. Furthermore, in-depth theoretical analyses are developed to guarantee the minimum estimation error, based on which a suite of algorithms leveraging the elaborating side information are proposed. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the designed algorithms provide more assured results than the off-the-shelf approaches in the context of the dual-band near-field communications in both on- and off-grid scenarios, where the angle of departures/arrivals are discretely or continuously distributed, respectively.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 10:40:18 UTC (7,668 KB)"

With the development of quantum communication, quantum networks based on optical fiber are gradually being established. In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and quantum network (ISAQN) scheme, which can achieve secure key distribution among multiple nodes and distributed sensing under the standard quantum limit. CV-QKD protocol and the round-trip multi-band structure are adopted to achieve the multi-node secure key distribution. Meanwhile, the spectrum phase monitoring (SPM) protocol is proposed to realize distributed sensing. It determines which node is vibrating by monitoring the frequency spectrum and restores the vibration waveform by monitoring the phase change. The scheme is experimentally demonstrated by simulating the vibration in a star structure network. Experimental results indicate that this multi-user quantum network can achieve a secret key rate (SKR) of approximately 0.7 $\rm{Mbits/s}$ for each user under 10 $\rm{km}$ standard fiber transmission and its network capacity is 8.

In sharp contrast to existing results, the dynamics of flexible spacecraft systems and external disturbances are allowed to be unknown. To deal with the challenges by these unknown factors, we develop a class of nonlinear internal models which converts the attitude tracking problem of uncertain flexible spacecraft systems into a regulation problem of an augmented system. Furthermore, to overcome the difficulties caused by the unmeasurable modal variable, the uncertainty introduced by the internal model, and the cross-coupling of the uncertainties with the system state, we design an auxiliary dynamic system for auxiliary stabilization, a dynamic compensator for dynamic compensation, and a linearly parameterized transformation for adaptive regulation in sequence. By introducing a series of coordinate and input transformations, we propose an adaptive dynamic control law to achieve regulation of the augmented system and thus leading to the solution to the attitude tracking problem. In addition, we analyze the convergence issue of the estimated parameter to its true value by the persistently exciting condition. Finally, the effec tiveness of the developed approach is verified by its application to the attitude manoeuvre of a flexible spacecraft system in the presence of external disturbances.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 08:37:57 UTC (443 KB)"

Currently, prevailing visual sensing approach typically involves a single static camera, resulting in a restricted and occluded field of view. In our work, we develop an active vision system using multiple cameras to dynamically capture multi-source RGB-D data. An integrated human sensing strategy based on a hierarchically connected tree structure is proposed to fuse localized visual information. Constituting the tree model are the nodes representing keypoints and the edges representing keyparts, which are consistently interconnected to preserve the structural constraints during multi-source fusion. Utilizing RGB-D data and HRNet, the 3D positions of keypoints are analytically estimated, and their presence is inferred through a sliding widow of confidence scores. Subsequently, the point clouds of reliable keyparts are extracted by drawing occlusion-resistant masks, enabling fine registration between data clouds and cylindrical model following the hierarchical order. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances keypart recognition recall from 69.20% to 90.10%, compared to employing a single static camera. Furthermore, in overcoming challenges related to localized and occluded perception, the robotic arm's obstacle avoidance capabilities are effectively improved.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 08:25:42 UTC (28,605 KB)"

It is a significant and challenging research area to complete the gearbox fault diagnosis procedure under varying operating conditions using vibration signals. This data article presents vibration datasets collected from a gearbox exhibiting various fault degrees of severity and fault types, operating under diverse speed and load conditions. These faults are manually implanted into the gears or bearings through precise machining processes, which include health, missing teeth, wear, pitting, root cracks, and broken teeth. Several kinds of actual compound faults are also encompassed.

Solving the corresponding Schrödinger equations can interpret or predict experimental spectra of molecules. In this study, we develop a novel approach to solve excited states of anharmonic vibrational systems. The normal coordinates of molecules are transformed into new coordinates through a normalizing flow parameterized by a neural network, facilitating the construction of a set of orthogonal many-body variational wavefunctions. Our methodology has been validated on an exactly solvable $64$-dimensional coupled harmonic oscillator, yielding numerical results with a relative error on the order of $10^{-6}$. Furthermore, the neural canonical transformations are also applied to calculate the energy levels of two specific molecules, acetonitrile ($\text{C}\text{H}_3\text{CN}$) and ethylene oxide ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4\text{O}$) involving $12$ and $15$ vibrational modes respectively, which are in agreement with experimental findings. One of the key advantages of our approach is its flexibility concerning the potential energy surface, requiring no specific form for its application. Moreover, this method can be easily implemented on large-scale distributed computing platforms, making it particularly suitable for investigating more complex vibrational structures.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 07:41:37 UTC (266 KB)"

Recent advances in literature have studied the network representations of deep neural networks. However, there has been little work that studies representations learned by SNNs, especially using unsupervised local learning methods like spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Recent work by \cite{barannikov2021representation} has introduced a novel method to compare topological mappings of learned representations called Representation Topology Divergence (RTD). Though useful, this method is engineered particularly for feedforward deep neural networks and cannot be used for recurrent networks like Recurrent SNNs (RSNNs). This paper introduces a novel methodology to use RTD to measure the difference between distributed representations of RSNN models with different learning methods. We propose a novel reformulation of RSNNs using feedforward autoencoder networks with skip connections to help us compute the RTD for recurrent networks. Thus, we investigate the learning capabilities of RSNN trained using STDP and the role of heterogeneity in the synaptic dynamics in learning such representations. We demonstrate that heterogeneous STDP in RSNNs yield distinct representations than their homogeneous and surrogate gradient-based supervised learning counterparts. Our results provide insights into the potential of heterogeneous SNN models, aiding the development of more efficient and biologically plausible hybrid artificial intelligence systems.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 05:37:26 UTC (5,327 KB)"

However, it is difficult for current techniques to display smooth animations using 8-bit images and to adjust display resolution, similar to conventional displays. We present ProgrammableGrass, an artificial grass display with scalable resolution, capable of swiftly controlling grass color at 8-bit levels. This grass display can control grass colors linearly at the 8-bit level, similar to an LCD display, and can also display not only 8-bit-based images but also videos. This display enables pixel-by-pixel color transitions from yellow to green using fixed-length yellow and adjustable-length green grass. We designed a grass module that can be connected to other modules. Utilizing a proportional derivative control, the grass colors are manipulated to display animations at approximately 10 [fps]. Since the relationship between grass lengths and colors is nonlinear, we developed a calibration system for ProgrammableGrass. We revealed that this calibration system allows ProgrammableGrass to linearly control grass colors at 8-bit levels through experiments under multiple conditions. Lastly, we demonstrate ProgrammableGrass to show smooth animations with 8-bit grayscale images. Moreover, we show several application examples to illustrate the potential of ProgrammableGrass.

Generally, preparing a target entangled state via unitary evolution with time-dependent couplings is a challenging task and very little is known about the existence of solutions and their properties. In this work we develop a constructive approach for preparing matrix product states (MPS) via continuous unitary evolution. We provide an explicit construction of the operator which exactly implements the evolution of a given MPS along a specified direction in its tangent space. This operator can be written as a sum of local terms of finite range, yet it is in general non-Hermitian. Relying on the explicit construction of the non-Hermitian generator of the dynamics, we demonstrate the existence of a Hermitian sequence of operators that implements the desired MPS evolution with the error which decreases exponentially with the operator range. The construction is benchmarked on an explicit periodic trajectory in a translationally invariant MPS manifold. We demonstrate that the Floquet unitary generating the dynamics over one period of the trajectory features an approximate MPS-like eigenstate embedded among a sea of thermalizing eigenstates. These results show that our construction is useful not only for state preparation and control of many-body systems, but also provides a generic route towards Floquet scars -- periodically driven models with quasi-local generators of dynamics that have exact MPS eigenstates in their spectrum.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 23:34:19 UTC (2,050 KB)"

The timescales and microscopic details of signal transmission in proteins are often unclear, despite a plethora of structural information on signaling proteins. Based on linear-response theory, we develop a theoretical framework to define frequency-dependent force and displacement transmit functions through proteins and, more generally, viscoelastic media. Transmit functions quantify the fraction of a local time-dependent perturbation at one site, be it a deformation, a force, or a combination thereof, that survives at a second site. They are defined in terms of equilibrium fluctuations from simulations or experimental observations. We apply the framework to our all-atom molecular dynamics simulation data of a parallel, homodimeric coiled-coil (CC) motif that connects sensor and effector modules of a blue-light-regulated histidine kinase from bacterial signaling systems extensively studied in experiments. Our analysis reveals that signal transmission through the CC is possible via shift, splay, and twist deformation modes.

Li","Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)","Developing theoretical frameworks for vibrational strong coupling (VSC) beyond the single-mode approximation is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of experiments with planar Fabry-Pérot cavities. Herein, a generalized cavity molecular dynamics (CavMD) scheme is developed to simulate VSC of a large ensemble of realistic molecules coupled to an arbitrary 1D or 2D photonic environment. This approach is built upon the Power-Zienau-Woolley Hamiltonian in the normal mode basis and uses a grid representation of the molecular ensembles to reduce the computational cost. When simulating the polariton dispersion relation for a homogeneous distribution of molecules in planar Fabry-Pérot cavities, our data highlight the importance of preserving the in-plane translational symmetry of the molecular distribution. In this homogeneous limit, CavMD yields the consistent polariton dispersion relation as analytic theory, i.e., incorporating many cavity modes with varying in-plane wave vectors ($k_{\parallel}$) produces the same spectrum as the system with a single cavity mode. Furthermore, CavMD reveals that the validity of the single mode approximation is challenged when nonequilibrium polariton dynamics are considered, as polariton-polariton scattering occurs between modes with nearest neighbor $k_{\parallel}$. Looking forward, our generalized CavMD approach may facilitate understanding vibrational polariton transport and condensation.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 22:02:38 UTC (2,836 KB)"

Such CI/CD configurations and services require synchronization during the life cycle of the projects. Several works discussed how CI/CD configuration and services change during their usage in traditional software systems. However, there is very limited knowledge of how CI/CD configuration and services change in ML projects.
To fill this knowledge gap, this work presents the first empirical analysis of how CI/CD configuration evolves for ML software systems. We manually analyzed 343 commits collected from 508 open-source ML projects to identify common CI/CD configuration change categories in ML projects and devised a taxonomy of 14 co-changes in CI/CD and ML components. Moreover, we developed a CI/CD configuration change clustering tool that identified frequent CI/CD configuration change patterns in 15,634 commits. Furthermore, we measured the expertise of ML developers who modify CI/CD configurations. Based on this analysis, we found that 61.8% of commits include a change to the build policy and minimal changes related to performance and maintainability compared to general open-source projects. Additionally, the co-evolution analysis identified that CI/CD configurations, in many cases, changed unnecessarily due to bad practices such as the direct inclusion of dependencies and a lack of usage of standardized testing frameworks. More practices were found through the change patterns analysis consisting of using deprecated settings and reliance on a generic build language. Finally, our developer's expertise analysis suggests that experienced developers are more inclined to modify CI/CD configurations.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 19:14:38 UTC (2,359 KB)"

Flavor conversions commence well before the putative unstable state is fully attained, and the final outcome depends on how the system is driven. Our results suggest that in an astrophysical setting, one should focus less on flavor instabilities in the neutrino radiation field and more on the external dynamics that leads to the formation of the unstable state.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 19:00:02 UTC (385 KB)"

Only both, (i) replacing isobutane by CO2 and (ii) adding 1000 to 3500 ppmv of water into the Ar/CO2 counting gas mixture, individually optimized for a given chamber, allowed to recover the chambers, enabling stable operation in several production runs since then, e.g. with high-intensity heavy-ion induced reactions. The origin of the instability was found to be deposits on the cathode wires, provoking the Malter-like effects, by visual inspection and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The charge on the wires accumulated during their lifetime does not point to so-called classical aging, but presumably the interaction of isobutane with materials in the gas flow, residual impurities, and reaction products formed in plasma, e.g., built by discharges.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 18:50:28 UTC (2,384 KB)"

The RSVT prior is developed based on two key observations regarding the relationship between hazy and haze-free points in the HSV color space. First, the hue component shows marginal variation between corresponding hazy and haze-free points, consolidating a hypothesis that the pixel value variability induced by haze primarily occurs in the saturation and value spaces. Second, in the 2D saturation-value coordinate system, most lines passing through hazy-clean point pairs are likely to intersect near the atmospheric light coordinates. Accordingly, haze removal for the bright regions can be performed by properly translating saturation-value coordinates. In addition, an effective soft segmentation method based on a morphological min-max channel is introduced. By combining the soft segmentation mask with the RSVT prior, a comprehensive single image dehazing framework is devised.

In this paper, we study the effects of communicating learned assistance from the robot back to the human operator. We do not focus on the specific interfaces used for communication. Instead, we develop experimental and theoretical models of a) how communication changes the way humans interact with assistive robot arms, and b) how robots can harness these changes to better align with the human's intent. We first conduct online and in-person user studies where participants operate robots that provide partial assistance, and we measure how the human's inputs change with and without communication. With communication, we find that humans are more likely to intervene when the robot incorrectly predicts their intent, and more likely to release control when the robot correctly understands their task. We then use these findings to modify an established robot learning algorithm so that the robot can correctly interpret the human's inputs when communication is present. Our results from a second in-person user study suggest that this combination of communication and learning outperforms assistive systems that isolate either learning or communication.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 17:55:52 UTC (2,280 KB)"

More specifically, lexicographic calculus is used to construct nonsmooth sensitivity rank condition (SERC) tests, which we call lexicographic SERC (L-SERC) tests. The introduced L-SERC tests are: (i) practically implementable and amenable to large-scale problems; (ii) accurate since they directly treat the nonsmoothness while avoiding, e.g., smoothing approximations; and (iii) analogous to (and indeed recover) their smooth counterparts. To accomplish this, a first-order Taylor-like approximation theory is developed using lexicographic differentiation to directly treat nonsmooth functions. A practically implementable algorithm is proposed that determines partial structural identifiability or observability, a useful characterization in the nonsmooth setting. Lastly, the theory is illustrated through an application in climate modeling.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 17:32:53 UTC (339 KB)"

Ahmed, Calin Curescu","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)","Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) systems involve computationally intensive image processing algorithms that can burden end-devices with limited resources, leading to poor performance in providing low latency services. Edge-to-cloud computing overcomes the limitations of end-devices by offloading their computations to nearby edge devices or remote cloud servers. Although this proves to be sufficient for many applications, optimal placement of latency sensitive AR/VR services in edge-to-cloud infrastructures (to provide desirable service response times and reliability) remain a formidable challenging. To address this challenge, this paper develops a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) to optimize the placement of AR/VR-based services in multi-tier edge-to-cloud environments. The primary objective of the proposed MOGA is to minimize the response time of all running services, while maximizing the reliability of the underlying system from both software and hardware perspectives. To evaluate its performance, we mathematically modeled all components and developed a tailor-made simulator to assess its effectiveness on various scales. MOGA was compared with several heuristics to prove that intuitive solutions, which are usually assumed sufficient, are not efficient enough for the stated problem. The experimental results indicated that MOGA can significantly reduce the response time of deployed services by an average of 67\% on different scales, compared to other heuristic methods. MOGA also ensures reliability of the 97\% infrastructure (hardware) and 95\% services (software).","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 15:54:56 UTC (1,379 KB)"

Tests of the divertor multi-instrument Bayesian analysis system (D-MIBAS) on a synthetic data set (including realistic experimental uncertainties) generated from SOLPS-ITER predictions of the MAST-U divertor have been performed. The resulting inference was within 6\%, 5\% and 30\% median absolute percentage error of the SOLPS-predicted electron temperature, electron density and neutral atomic hydrogen density, respectively, across a two-dimensional poloidal cross-section of the MAST-U Super-X outer divertor.
To accommodate molecular contributions to Balmer emission, an advanced emission model has been developed which is shown to be crucial for inference accuracy. Our D-MIBAS system utilises a mesh aligned to poloidal magnetic flux-surfaces, throughout the divertor, with plasma parameters assigned to each mesh vertex and collectively considered in the inference. This allowed comprehensive forward models to multiple diagnostics and the inclusion of expected physics. This is shown to be important for inference precision when including molecular contributions to Balmer emission. These developments pave the way for accurate two-dimensional electron temperature, electron density and neutral atomic hydrogen density inferences for MAST-U divertor experimental data for the first time.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 15:18:03 UTC (3,585 KB)"

Vincent Poor","Information Theory (cs.IT)","Acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) at an access point (AP) is challenging for wideband millimeter wave (mmWave) ultra-massive multiple-input and multiple-output (UMMIMO) systems, due to the high-dimensional channel matrices, hybrid near- and far- field channel feature, beam squint effects, and imperfect hardware constraints, such as low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, and in-phase and quadrature imbalance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient downlink channel estimation (CE) and CSI feedback approach based on knowledge and data dual-driven deep learning (DL) networks. Specifically, we first propose a data-driven residual neural network de-quantizer (ResNet-DQ) to pre-process the received pilot signals at user equipment (UEs), where the noise and distortion brought by imperfect hardware can be mitigated. A knowledge-driven generalized multiple measurement vector learned approximate message passing (GMMV-LAMP) network is then developed to jointly estimate the channels by exploiting the approximately same physical angle shared by different subcarriers. In particular, two wideband redundant dictionaries (WRDs) are proposed such that the measurement matrices of the GMMV-LAMP network can accommodate the far-field and near-field beam squint effect, respectively. Finally, we propose an encoder at the UEs and a decoder at the AP by a data-driven CSI residual network (CSI-ResNet) to compress the CSI matrix into a low-dimensional quantized bit vector for feedback, thereby reducing the feedback overhead substantially. Simulation results show that the proposed knowledge and data dual-driven approach outperforms conventional downlink CE and CSI feedback methods, especially in the case of low signal-to-noise ratios.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 15:12:56 UTC (14,198 KB)"

For example, small body binaries are particularly valuable for measuring masses. By extending the models of small body binaries beyond point masses, new information about the shape and spin orientation becomes available. This is particularly informative for Trans-Neptunian multiples (two or more components) where shapes and spin orientations are poorly understood. Going beyond point masses requires modeling tools that no longer assume fixed Keplerian orbits.

However, when the transmitter and receiver are in near-field ranges, this will result in relatively low computing accuracy. To tackle this challenge, we initially develop an analytical framework for sub-array partitioning. This framework divides the large-scale RIS array into multiple sub-arrays, effectively reducing modeling complexity while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Then, we develop a beam domain channel model based on the proposed sub-array partition framework for large-scale RIS-enabled UAV-to-vehicle communication systems, which can be used to efficiently capture the sparse features in RIS-enabled UAV-to-vehicle channels in both near-field and far-field ranges. Furthermore, some important propagation characteristics of the proposed channel model, including the spatial cross-correlation functions (CCFs), temporal auto-correlation functions (ACFs), frequency correlation functions (CFs), and channel capacities with respect to the different physical features of the RIS and non-stationary properties of the channel model are derived and analyzed. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed framework is helpful to achieve a good tradeoff between model complexity and accuracy for investigating the channel propagation characteristics, and therefore providing highly-efficient communications in RIS-enabled UAV-to-vehicle wireless networks.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 14:48:10 UTC (1,183 KB)"

The deformation-curl decomposition developed by the second author and his collaborator is utilized to effectively decouple the elliptic-hyperbolic mixed structure in the steady compressible Euler equation. A key parameter in the helical symmetry is the step (denoted by $\sigma$), which denotes the magnitude of the translation along the symmetry axis after rotating one full turn. It is shown that the step determines the type of the first order partial differential system satisfied by the radial and vertical velocity. There exists a critical number $\sigma_{*}$ depending only on the background transonic flows, such that if $0<\sigma<\sigma_{*}$, one can prove the existence and uniqueness of smooth helically symmetric transonic flows with nonzero vorticity.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 14:29:57 UTC (14 KB)"

The system converges to a stationary point of the constrained optimization problem through suitable regulation.

Generally, measurement methods for characterizing the material are based on the usage of vector network analyzer, which is large and not easy for on-site measurement, especially in high frequency range such as millimeter wave (mmWave). In addition, some measurement methods require the destruction of samples, which is not suitable for non-destructive inspection. In this work, a small distance increment (SDI) method is proposed to non-destructively measure the complex permittivity of material. In SDI, the transmitter and receiver are formed as the monostatic radar, which is facing towards the material under test (MUT). During the measurement, the distance between radar and MUT changes with small increments and the signals are recorded at each position. A mathematical model is formulated to depict the relationship among the complex permittivity, distance increment, and measured signals. By fitting the model, the complex permittivity of MUT is estimated. To implement and evaluate the proposed SDI method, a commercial off-the-shelf mmWave radar is utilized and the measurement system is developed. Then, the evaluation was carried out on the acrylic plate. With the proposed method, the estimated complex permittivity of acrylic plate shows good agreement with the literature values, demonstrating the efficacy of SDI method for characterizing the complex permittivity of material.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 13:42:16 UTC (980 KB)"

The technique combines interferometric measurements, acquired with a special setup, and sophisticated mathematical evaluation procedures. To determine the form of the surface under test, a computational model is required that closely mimics the measurement process of the physical measurement instruments. The parameters of the computational model, comprising the surface under test sought, are then tuned by solving an inverse problem. Due to this embedded structure of the real experiment and computational model and the overall complexity, a thorough uncertainty evaluation is challenging. In this work, a Bayesian approach is proposed to tackle the inverse problem, based on a statistical model derived from the computational model of the tilted-wave interferometer. Such a procedure naturally allows for uncertainty quantification to be made. We present an approximate inference scheme to efficiently sample quantities of the posterior using Monte Carlo sampling involving the statistical model. In particular, the methodology derived is applied to the tilted-wave interferometer to obtain an estimate and corresponding uncertainty of the pixel-by-pixel form of the surface under test for two typical surfaces taking into account a number of key influencing factors. A statistical analysis using experimental design is employed to identify main influencing factors and a subsequent analysis confirms the efficacy of the method derived.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 13:25:59 UTC (3,802 KB)"

However, beyond rigid grasping and re-grasping, in-hand following is also an essential skill that humans use to dexterously manipulate DLOs, which requires continuously changing the grasp point by in-hand sliding while holding the DLO to prevent it from falling. Achieving such a skill is very challenging for robots without using specially designed but not versatile end-effectors. Previous works have attempted using generic parallel grippers, but their robustness is unsatisfactory owing to the conflict between following and holding, which is hard to balance with a one-degree-of-freedom gripper. In this work, inspired by how humans use fingers to follow DLOs, we explore the usage of a generic dexterous hand with tactile sensing to imitate human skills and achieve robust in-hand DLO following. To enable the hardware system to function in the real world, we develop a framework that includes Cartesian-space arm-hand control, tactile-based in-hand 3-D DLO pose estimation, and task-specific motion design. Experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of our method over using parallel grippers, as well as its great robustness, generalizability, and efficiency.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 12:21:23 UTC (1,348 KB)"

Finally, our results show that the storage and loss moduli of mixtures of divalent and $M$-valent particles exhibit an apparent power-law dependence on frequency, hinting at the possibility of using the composition to finely tune the rheological response of these materials. Our results compare well with literature experimental data on valence-limited DNA nanostars.

Due to the substantial number of antennas, the electromagnetic radiation field is modeled by the spherical waves instead of the conventional planar waves, leading to severe weak sparsity to angular-domain near-field channel. Therefore, the channel estimation reminiscent of the conventional compression sensing (CS) approaches in the angular domain, judiciously utilized for low pilot overhead, may result in unprecedented challenges. To this end, this paper proposes a brand-new near-field channel estimation scheme by exploiting the naturally occurring useful side information. Specifically, we formulate the dual-band near-field communication model based on the fact that high-frequency systems are likely to be deployed with lower-frequency systems. Representative side information, i.e., the structural characteristic information derived by the sparsity ambiguity and the out-of-band spatial information stemming from the lower-frequency channel, is explored and tailored to materialize exceptional near-field channel estimation. Furthermore, in-depth theoretical analyses are developed to guarantee the minimum estimation error, based on which a suite of algorithms leveraging the elaborating side information are proposed. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the designed algorithms provide more assured results than the off-the-shelf approaches in the context of the dual-band near-field communications in both on- and off-grid scenarios, where the angle of departures/arrivals are discretely or continuously distributed, respectively.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 10:40:18 UTC (7,668 KB)"

With the development of quantum communication, quantum networks based on optical fiber are gradually being established. In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and quantum network (ISAQN) scheme, which can achieve secure key distribution among multiple nodes and distributed sensing under the standard quantum limit. CV-QKD protocol and the round-trip multi-band structure are adopted to achieve the multi-node secure key distribution. Meanwhile, the spectrum phase monitoring (SPM) protocol is proposed to realize distributed sensing. It determines which node is vibrating by monitoring the frequency spectrum and restores the vibration waveform by monitoring the phase change. The scheme is experimentally demonstrated by simulating the vibration in a star structure network. Experimental results indicate that this multi-user quantum network can achieve a secret key rate (SKR) of approximately 0.7 $\rm{Mbits/s}$ for each user under 10 $\rm{km}$ standard fiber transmission and its network capacity is 8. In terms of distributed sensing, it can achieve a vibration response bandwidth ranging from 1 $\rm{Hz}$ to 2 $\rm{kHz}$, a strain resolution of 0.50 $\rm{n}$$\varepsilon$$/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$, and a spatial resolution of 0.20 $\rm{m}$ under shot-noise-limited detection.

To deal with the challenges by these unknown factors, we develop a class of nonlinear internal models which converts the attitude tracking problem of uncertain flexible spacecraft systems into a regulation problem of an augmented system. Furthermore, to overcome the difficulties caused by the unmeasurable modal variable, the uncertainty introduced by the internal model, and the cross-coupling of the uncertainties with the system state, we design an auxiliary dynamic system for auxiliary stabilization, a dynamic compensator for dynamic compensation, and a linearly parameterized transformation for adaptive regulation in sequence. By introducing a series of coordinate and input transformations, we propose an adaptive dynamic control law to achieve regulation of the augmented system and thus leading to the solution to the attitude tracking problem. In addition, we analyze the convergence issue of the estimated parameter to its true value by the persistently exciting condition. Finally, the effec tiveness of the developed approach is verified by its application to the attitude manoeuvre of a flexible spacecraft system in the presence of external disturbances.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 08:37:57 UTC (443 KB)"

Currently, prevailing visual sensing approach typically involves a single static camera, resulting in a restricted and occluded field of view. In our work, we develop an active vision system using multiple cameras to dynamically capture multi-source RGB-D data. An integrated human sensing strategy based on a hierarchically connected tree structure is proposed to fuse localized visual information. Constituting the tree model are the nodes representing keypoints and the edges representing keyparts, which are consistently interconnected to preserve the structural constraints during multi-source fusion. Utilizing RGB-D data and HRNet, the 3D positions of keypoints are analytically estimated, and their presence is inferred through a sliding widow of confidence scores. Subsequently, the point clouds of reliable keyparts are extracted by drawing occlusion-resistant masks, enabling fine registration between data clouds and cylindrical model following the hierarchical order. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances keypart recognition recall from 69.20% to 90.10%, compared to employing a single static camera. Furthermore, in overcoming challenges related to localized and occluded perception, the robotic arm's obstacle avoidance capabilities are effectively improved.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 08:25:42 UTC (28,605 KB)"

It is a significant and challenging research area to complete the gearbox fault diagnosis procedure under varying operating conditions using vibration signals. This data article presents vibration datasets collected from a gearbox exhibiting various fault degrees of severity and fault types, operating under diverse speed and load conditions. These faults are manually implanted into the gears or bearings through precise machining processes, which include health, missing teeth, wear, pitting, root cracks, and broken teeth.

Solving the corresponding Schrödinger equations can interpret or predict experimental spectra of molecules. In this study, we develop a novel approach to solve excited states of anharmonic vibrational systems. The normal coordinates of molecules are transformed into new coordinates through a normalizing flow parameterized by a neural network, facilitating the construction of a set of orthogonal many-body variational wavefunctions. Our methodology has been validated on an exactly solvable $64$-dimensional coupled harmonic oscillator, yielding numerical results with a relative error on the order of $10^{-6}$. Furthermore, the neural canonical transformations are also applied to calculate the energy levels of two specific molecules, acetonitrile ($\text{C}\text{H}_3\text{CN}$) and ethylene oxide ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4\text{O}$) involving $12$ and $15$ vibrational modes respectively, which are in agreement with experimental findings. One of the key advantages of our approach is its flexibility concerning the potential energy surface, requiring no specific form for its application. Moreover, this method can be easily implemented on large-scale distributed computing platforms, making it particularly suitable for investigating more complex vibrational structures.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 07:41:37 UTC (266 KB)"

Recent advances in literature have studied the network representations of deep neural networks. However, there has been little work that studies representations learned by SNNs, especially using unsupervised local learning methods like spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Recent work by \cite{barannikov2021representation} has introduced a novel method to compare topological mappings of learned representations called Representation Topology Divergence (RTD). Though useful, this method is engineered particularly for feedforward deep neural networks and cannot be used for recurrent networks like Recurrent SNNs (RSNNs). This paper introduces a novel methodology to use RTD to measure the difference between distributed representations of RSNN models with different learning methods. We propose a novel reformulation of RSNNs using feedforward autoencoder networks with skip connections to help us compute the RTD for recurrent networks. Thus, we investigate the learning capabilities of RSNN trained using STDP and the role of heterogeneity in the synaptic dynamics in learning such representations. We demonstrate that heterogeneous STDP in RSNNs yield distinct representations than their homogeneous and surrogate gradient-based supervised learning counterparts. Our results provide insights into the potential of heterogeneous SNN models, aiding the development of more efficient and biologically plausible hybrid artificial intelligence systems.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 05:37:26 UTC (5,327 KB)"

However, such systems are often not designed to be transparent about their limitations; a user may easily prompt a model with an instruction without any idea of whether the responses should be expected to be accurate, or if the system is even capable of performing the task. We propose a third party performance prediction framework, where a separate model is trained to predict the metric resulting from evaluating an instruction-following system on a task while assuming access only to its inputs and outputs at inference time. We perform this analysis with a variety of both open and closed instruction-following models as well as multiple performance predictors, and examine the effect of various factors such as model size, number of training tasks, and prompt format. Our findings indicate that third-party performance prediction is very challenging, and much work remains in developing predictors that can automatically reveal the limitations of modern instruction-following natural language processing systems.","Tue, 19 Mar 2024 03:53:47 UTC (2,838 KB)"

However, it is difficult for current techniques to display smooth animations using 8-bit images and to adjust display resolution, similar to conventional displays. We present ProgrammableGrass, an artificial grass display with scalable resolution, capable of swiftly controlling grass color at 8-bit levels. This grass display can control grass colors linearly at the 8-bit level, similar to an LCD display, and can also display not only 8-bit-based images but also videos. This display enables pixel-by-pixel color transitions from yellow to green using fixed-length yellow and adjustable-length green grass. We designed a grass module that can be connected to other modules. Utilizing a proportional derivative control, the grass colors are manipulated to display animations at approximately 10 [fps]. Since the relationship between grass lengths and colors is nonlinear, we developed a calibration system for ProgrammableGrass. We revealed that this calibration system allows ProgrammableGrass to linearly control grass colors at 8-bit levels through experiments under multiple conditions. Lastly, we demonstrate ProgrammableGrass to show smooth animations with 8-bit grayscale images. Moreover, we show several application examples to illustrate the potential of ProgrammableGrass.

Generally, preparing a target entangled state via unitary evolution with time-dependent couplings is a challenging task and very little is known about the existence of solutions and their properties. In this work we develop a constructive approach for preparing matrix product states (MPS) via continuous unitary evolution. We provide an explicit construction of the operator which exactly implements the evolution of a given MPS along a specified direction in its tangent space. This operator can be written as a sum of local terms of finite range, yet it is in general non-Hermitian. Relying on the explicit construction of the non-Hermitian generator of the dynamics, we demonstrate the existence of a Hermitian sequence of operators that implements the desired MPS evolution with the error which decreases exponentially with the operator range. The construction is benchmarked on an explicit periodic trajectory in a translationally invariant MPS manifold. We demonstrate that the Floquet unitary generating the dynamics over one period of the trajectory features an approximate MPS-like eigenstate embedded among a sea of thermalizing eigenstates. These results show that our construction is useful not only for state preparation and control of many-body systems, but also provides a generic route towards Floquet scars -- periodically driven models with quasi-local generators of dynamics that have exact MPS eigenstates in their spectrum.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 23:34:19 UTC (2,050 KB)"

Netz","Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)","On the microscopic level, biological signal transmission relies on coordinated structural changes in allosteric proteins that involve sensor and effector modules. The timescales and microscopic details of signal transmission in proteins are often unclear, despite a plethora of structural information on signaling proteins. Based on linear-response theory, we develop a theoretical framework to define frequency-dependent force and displacement transmit functions through proteins and, more generally, viscoelastic media. Transmit functions quantify the fraction of a local time-dependent perturbation at one site, be it a deformation, a force, or a combination thereof, that survives at a second site. They are defined in terms of equilibrium fluctuations from simulations or experimental observations. We apply the framework to our all-atom molecular dynamics simulation data of a parallel, homodimeric coiled-coil (CC) motif that connects sensor and effector modules of a blue-light-regulated histidine kinase from bacterial signaling systems extensively studied in experiments. Our analysis reveals that signal transmission through the CC is possible via shift, splay, and twist deformation modes. Based on the results of mutation experiments, we infer that the most relevant mode for the biological function of the histidine kinase protein is the splay deformation.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 23:19:33 UTC (7,488 KB)"

Li","Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)","Developing theoretical frameworks for vibrational strong coupling (VSC) beyond the single-mode approximation is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of experiments with planar Fabry-Pérot cavities. Herein, a generalized cavity molecular dynamics (CavMD) scheme is developed to simulate VSC of a large ensemble of realistic molecules coupled to an arbitrary 1D or 2D photonic environment. This approach is built upon the Power-Zienau-Woolley Hamiltonian in the normal mode basis and uses a grid representation of the molecular ensembles to reduce the computational cost. When simulating the polariton dispersion relation for a homogeneous distribution of molecules in planar Fabry-Pérot cavities, our data highlight the importance of preserving the in-plane translational symmetry of the molecular distribution. In this homogeneous limit, CavMD yields the consistent polariton dispersion relation as analytic theory, i.e., incorporating many cavity modes with varying in-plane wave vectors ($k_{\parallel}$) produces the same spectrum as the system with a single cavity mode. Furthermore, CavMD reveals that the validity of the single mode approximation is challenged when nonequilibrium polariton dynamics are considered, as polariton-polariton scattering occurs between modes with nearest neighbor $k_{\parallel}$. Looking forward, our generalized CavMD approach may facilitate understanding vibrational polariton transport and condensation.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 22:02:38 UTC (2,836 KB)"

Such CI/CD configurations and services require synchronization during the life cycle of the projects. Several works discussed how CI/CD configuration and services change during their usage in traditional software systems. However, there is very limited knowledge of how CI/CD configuration and services change in ML projects.
To fill this knowledge gap, this work presents the first empirical analysis of how CI/CD configuration evolves for ML software systems. We manually analyzed 343 commits collected from 508 open-source ML projects to identify common CI/CD configuration change categories in ML projects and devised a taxonomy of 14 co-changes in CI/CD and ML components. Moreover, we developed a CI/CD configuration change clustering tool that identified frequent CI/CD configuration change patterns in 15,634 commits. Furthermore, we measured the expertise of ML developers who modify CI/CD configurations. Based on this analysis, we found that 61.8% of commits include a change to the build policy and minimal changes related to performance and maintainability compared to general open-source projects. Additionally, the co-evolution analysis identified that CI/CD configurations, in many cases, changed unnecessarily due to bad practices such as the direct inclusion of dependencies and a lack of usage of standardized testing frameworks. More practices were found through the change patterns analysis consisting of using deprecated settings and reliance on a generic build language. Finally, our developer's expertise analysis suggests that experienced developers are more inclined to modify CI/CD configurations.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 19:14:38 UTC (2,359 KB)"

Flavor conversions commence well before the putative unstable state is fully attained, and the final outcome depends on how the system is driven.

Only both, (i) replacing isobutane by CO2 and (ii) adding 1000 to 3500 ppmv of water into the Ar/CO2 counting gas mixture, individually optimized for a given chamber, allowed to recover the chambers, enabling stable operation in several production runs since then, e.g. with high-intensity heavy-ion induced reactions. The origin of the instability was found to be deposits on the cathode wires, provoking the Malter-like effects, by visual inspection and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The charge on the wires accumulated during their lifetime does not point to so-called classical aging, but presumably the interaction of isobutane with materials in the gas flow, residual impurities, and reaction products formed in plasma, e.g., built by discharges.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 18:50:28 UTC (2,384 KB)"

The RSVT prior is developed based on two key observations regarding the relationship between hazy and haze-free points in the HSV color space. First, the hue component shows marginal variation between corresponding hazy and haze-free points, consolidating a hypothesis that the pixel value variability induced by haze primarily occurs in the saturation and value spaces. Second, in the 2D saturation-value coordinate system, most lines passing through hazy-clean point pairs are likely to intersect near the atmospheric light coordinates. Accordingly, haze removal for the bright regions can be performed by properly translating saturation-value coordinates. In addition, an effective soft segmentation method based on a morphological min-max channel is introduced. By combining the soft segmentation mask with the RSVT prior, a comprehensive single image dehazing framework is devised. Experimental results on various synthetic and realistic hazy image datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme successfully addresses color distortion issues and restores visually appealing images.

The study contributes to narrowing the resource gap for Taiwanese Hokkien and empirically investigates the advantages and limitations of pre-training and fine-tuning based on LLaMA 2.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 17:56:13 UTC (6,747 KB)"
"150","Aligning Learning with Communication in Shared Autonomy","Joshua Hoegerman, Shahabedin Sagheb, Benjamin A. Christie, Dylan P. Losey","Robotics (cs.RO)","Assistive robot arms can help humans by partially automating their desired tasks. Consider an adult with motor impairments controlling an assistive robot arm to eat dinner. The robot can reduce the number of human inputs -- and how precise those inputs need to be -- by recognizing what the human wants (e.g., a fork) and assisting for that task (e.g., moving towards the fork). Prior research has largely focused on learning the human's task and providing meaningful assistance. But as the robot learns and assists, we also need to ensure that the human understands the robot's intent (e.g., does the human know the robot is reaching for a fork?). In this paper, we study the effects of communicating learned assistance from the robot back to the human operator. We do not focus on the specific interfaces used for communication. Instead, we develop experimental and theoretical models of a) how communication changes the way humans interact with assistive robot arms, and b) how robots can harness these changes to better align with the human's intent. We first conduct online and in-person user studies where participants operate robots that provide partial assistance, and we measure how the human's inputs change with and without communication. With communication, we find that humans are more likely to intervene when the robot incorrectly predicts their intent, and more likely to release control when the robot correctly understands their task. We then use these findings to modify an established robot learning algorithm so that the robot can correctly interpret the human's inputs when communication is present. Our results from a second in-person user study suggest that this combination of communication and learning outperforms assistive systems that isolate either learning or communication.","Mon, 18 Mar 2024 17:55:52 UTC (2,280 KB)"
