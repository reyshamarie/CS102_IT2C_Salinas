to master the audio music sound effects and foley sounds in projects i will listen to the mixdown both on headphones and then the studio monitors afterwardsmy needs clear distortionfree full sounding headphones with no artificial noise cancellation or artificially boosted frequencies that capture the nuance of sound from the deep rumble of earth tremors to the whine of mechanical gears moving and still be able to throw on a playlist of drum  bass or chunky house music to groove to while creating landscapes previs concepts modelling or sculptingi read up on all sorts of headphones and iems checked on reviews consulted with friends with similar backgrounds surprisingly these iems came recommended by several connections and reviewers i had a hard time believing that a pair of  inear monitors could compete with my shure s that died and the pioneer djes that i used as a club djbefore i go into a review i will say that i purchased the linsoul tripowin core iem cable the same time i purchased these monitors and have not used the included core standard cable more on that laterpros price hands down this is the number one advantage to these iems i dont need to expand on that too much  cdn for this quality is ridiculous sound hzkhz frequency range is also ridiculous the added db of base from the previous model hz zero does punch up the bass in music some but not to the point of creating crackling distortion or sound fake when listening to spoken words vs music for creators the added depth hz from usual hz of frequency and low end warmth created by the db boost is magnificent whether authoring music for an animation creating layers of sound effects for atmosphere or mastering spoken words in video  the sound is clean neutral and true to what you will hear in playback unlike consumer brand bass heavy augmented headphones clarity as above very clean and truetolife sound reproduction whether used on pc mac smart phone or tablet these just sound good period after a total of  hours of testing i found no discernible ear fatigue comfort i spend a lot of time in front of a computer with headphones on comfort is   after sound quality i opened the box installed the cable and kept these inear for more than  hours without noticing any discomfort i can easily see myself doing a straight  hours or more without issue the units are light enough fit the ear very well are stable when turning from screentoscreen and typingdrawingmousing stars for comfort alone linsoul tripowin core replacement cable  truth be told i havent bothered to plug in the supplied core cable that came with the zero i bought the replacement cable at the same time as the iems for a reason more coresmore sound if you read this and choose to buy the hzcrinacle zero iems buy this cable dont think just add it to your cart and thank me later very well made easy to install and the sound  well core number counts for something theres a reason cpus are getting more cores and threads yearoveryearnow cons std cable supply the core cable standard and add  to the retail price people will still buy the replacements but cmon guys give the drivers the love they deservea cable length the tripowin cable is m and the included cable is marginally shorter these are fine lengths for hooking up to a remote transmission system for musicians  when working on a pc or mac desktop well its a bit short if im being honest maybe this is splitting hairs but if there was a way to have a m main cable and include a m extension that would be ideal for those of us tied to a desk rather than rippin a phat guitar solo no foam ear tips  this kinda hurt a bit i loathe silicon ear tips always have and always will yes shure and pioneer cost  times the price of the zero they also come standard with both silicon and comply tips im not saying linsoul needs to include comply however for me i know that heat sensitive foam tips create a better seal inear and therefore cancels out  of background noise allowing me to significantly lower the volume and saving my ear drums from the fatigue of daily sustained audio vibrations put foam tips in the package charge an extra  if you must your customers will thank you no case  i mean really this should just be a standard not an upgrade i cant think of a single reason a case is not an automatic addition to the purchase does anyone at linsoul have a cat at home include a case and save the rest of us from having to find kittys new toy after we make a sandwichoverall i give these  stars for the important things sound comfort price points were deducted for the important nicetohaves no foam tips core std cable no case the cons werent enough for me to reduce the initial joy of listening to these iems for the first time but they are something the manufacturer should think about whenif the zero is being designed and packagedhope this helps some of the fence sitters and head scratcherspeace love  good music  also happy new year

","client damazon","verified purchase",2019-02-16,5,"        month edit still great sound quality and durability due to personal issues with fit and other minor details id alter my rating to ive grown to really like the sound from these im happy to use them for casual mixing with caveats when i dont want to use headphones and im impressed with the build and ruggedness they make me want to listen to music for the fun of it and thats something the isolation is hilariously good if you get a good fit almost as good as putting in foam earplugs even though you dont stuff these into the ear canalsonically even with a mm driver the sound is impressive with good detail up top and with the low bass tending towards fun rather than accurate personally i like that for the price it makes audio exciting makes this more of an allrounder that bass doesnt muddy the low mids  its just a bit of supplementation to support the rest of the sound the high mids are good for music but a little too prominent for speech leading sometimes to more sibilance than id like around khz but thats the only thing id want changing soundwise and it doesnt actually bother me on music if you dont like the bass here its pretty easy to eq it down on most smartphones by about db without artefactsnot at all a super wide soundstage like you get with a campfire audio earphones but they would cost  times the price of this i like the immediacy of this set if i want soundstage ill go for listening with openback headphonesbuild is solid with plenty of accessories good carry case two cables one with mic plenty of silicone tips inc large and small triple flanges and one set of foam earphones as well that second cable with a mic is great in case one cable breaks seems unlikely and it doesnt affect the sound quality at all however the mic quality is poor very muffled so id save it for short calls when youre not in noisy environment i keep that cable on purely for the playpause button  or assistant if you wish cables are really nice and strong but theres a fair bit of cable noise strangely though you get used to this and theres an included clip which might helpcomfortwise they took a bit of getting used to the cables are detachable  though they aid the noise isolation by creating the seal so keep them attached for best isolation the memory wire works with a metal wire encased with the cabling for about cm from the earphone because of this the wires profile is larger and slightly stretched and can get in the way of larger glasses stalks it takes some days of getting used to but its worth the experimentation they also help to relieve stress on the earphone if they get yanked out accidentally and when running they do keep the earphones on the ear rather than falling to the groundbut the fit is still really incumbent on the main module fitting well and with my small ears ive found that even when walking they come loose sooner than i want regardless of tips used maybe i should get some custom ones if i put on a sprint theyll be loose very quickly and you lose all the bass if the fit is off but thats just my ears you might honestly find them perfect running partners when im not moving around they stay in place well not headphonewell but enough that it doesnt bother mefor sure though theyre not the best for sidesleepers listening at night theyre a fair bit larger than say apples old earphones which for all their faults are probably my pick for that use case with their very flat profilea few misconceptions these are noise isolating but not noise cancelling dont expect the sudden eerie quiet you get from a bose quietcomfort or sony wh series when you turn those on however the isolation is so good that i have trouble understanding the person speaking next to me even indoors especially with the comply foam tips used from reading tech reviews these apparently isolate nearly as well as shure earphones which have the best isolation around no reason to doubt this these arent for highlevel mixing reference sound quality is never this inexpensive they would work well for monitoring audio on location because they isolate so well and the bass boost will compensate for the bass frequencies from the environment which are impossible to isolate out ive also used these on stage but i dont recommend that the isolation is just too good you cant make out anything else properly i ended up taking them off on that occasionoverall then for earphones with wires going over the ear these are probably the best value around i got the clear pair for  expect a solid build and good sound quality and be prepared to spend some time getting the right fit for your ears if you want something better youll probably need to spend more ive enjoyed having these beside my akg k bose qc soundmagic e and earpods all very different all useful the m pro nd are the best allrounders of them all  "

","client damazon","verified purchase",2019-02-16,5,"        month edit still great sound quality and durability due to personal issues with fit and other minor details id alter my rating to ive grown to really like the sound from these im happy to use them for casual mixing with caveats when i dont want to use headphones and im impressed with the build and ruggedness they make me want to listen to music for the fun of it and thats something the isolation is hilariously good if you get a good fit almost as good as putting in foam earplugs even though you dont stuff these into the ear canalsonically even with a mm driver the sound is impressive with good detail up top and with the low bass tending towards fun rather than accurate personally i like that for the price it makes audio exciting makes this more of an allrounder that bass doesnt muddy the low mids  its just a bit of supplementation to support the rest of the sound the high mids are good for music but a little too prominent for speech leading sometimes to more sibilance than id like around khz but thats the only thing id want changing soundwise and it doesnt actually bother me on music if you dont like the bass here its pretty easy to eq it down on most smartphones by about db without artefactsnot at all a super wide soundstage like you get with a campfire audio earphones but they would cost  times the price of this i like the immediacy of this set if i want soundstage ill go for listening with openback headphonesbuild is solid with plenty of accessories good carry case two cables one with mic plenty of silicone tips inc large and small triple flanges and one set of foam earphones as well that second cable with a mic is great in case one cable breaks seems unlikely and it doesnt affect the sound quality at all however the mic quality is poor very muffled so id save it for short calls when youre not in noisy environment i keep that cable on purely for the playpause button  or assistant if you wish cables are really nice and strong but theres a fair bit of cable noise strangely though you get used to this and theres an included clip which might helpcomfortwise they took a bit of getting used to the cables are detachable  though they aid the noise isolation by creating the seal so keep them attached for best isolation the memory wire works with a metal wire encased with the cabling for about cm from the earphone because of this the wires profile is larger and slightly stretched and can get in the way of larger glasses stalks it takes some days of getting used to but its worth the experimentation they also help to relieve stress on the earphone if they get yanked out accidentally and when running they do keep the earphones on the ear rather than falling to the groundbut the fit is still really incumbent on the main module fitting well and with my small ears ive found that even when walking they come loose sooner than i want regardless of tips used maybe i should get some custom ones if i put on a sprint theyll be loose very quickly and you lose all the bass if the fit is off but thats just my ears you might honestly find them perfect running partners when im not moving around they stay in place well not headphonewell but enough that it doesnt bother mefor sure though theyre not the best for sidesleepers listening at night theyre a fair bit larger than say apples old earphones which for all their faults are probably my pick for that use case with their very flat profilea few misconceptions these are noise isolating but not noise cancelling dont expect the sudden eerie quiet you get from a bose quietcomfort or sony wh series when you turn those on however the isolation is so good that i have trouble understanding the person speaking next to me even indoors especially with the comply foam tips used from reading tech reviews these apparently isolate nearly as well as shure earphones which have the best isolation around no reason to doubt this these arent for highlevel mixing reference sound quality is never this inexpensive they would work well for monitoring audio on location because they isolate so well and the bass boost will compensate for the bass frequencies from the environment which are impossible to isolate out ive also used these on stage but i dont recommend that the isolation is just too good you cant make out anything else properly i ended up taking them off on that occasionoverall then for earphones with wires going over the ear these are probably the best value around i got the clear pair for  expect a solid build and good sound quality and be prepared to spend some time getting the right fit for your ears if you want something better youll probably need to spend more ive enjoyed having these beside my akg k bose qc soundmagic e and earpods all very different all useful the m pro nd are the best allrounders of them all  "

wexler","verified purchase",2021-03-11,5,"        lets get the obvious out of the way these buds are larger than you expect and heavier in part due to the mm driver same as the more expensive momentum line from sennheiser but you wont care about the size or weight because they just sound so so incrediblethat mm  driver does make amazing sound better than any wireless earbud ive tried and for around  at the time of my purchase this has better quality sound  dollar than anything ive triedbut there are some odd design decisions  the touch surface for the control on the outside of the big block is hypersensitive even a quick touch from my hand can trigger a pause much more sensitive than say airpods pro  on the good side you can control volume from these but its a bit tricky due to the sensitivity  for all the audio quality i found i had to set the volume higher with these than with other earbuds on both iphone and windows pc bluetooth in windows  go to sound in the control panel under hardware and sound highlight your headphones click properties and select the enhancements tab check loudness equalization and hit apply to turn this on helps a ton  with the plugs in your do get good isolation from the outside so passive noise reduction though of course you now hear every breath and gurgle from inside your body as you do with any sealedear device  even with a bluetooth  connection they support up to  on the pc bt lag is still present this is really evident watching videos and to some extent on video conferences  the buds stick out from your head and are heavy so extended wearing became earcanal sore but never really painful  the ear tips are silicone but less flexible than from other vendors i usually wear a medium in other earbuds but it feels a touch large for my ears the small felt too small  i may invest in comply foam for the first timethe buds support sbc aac and aptx which is nice for ios or android users  microphone quality is the usual its good enough but not as good as airpods pro and clearly not the primary focus of the buds  itll be ok but expect to have to repeat sometimes as with almost every wireless earbud out there  also i missed the autoshutoff from so many of the other modern earbuds these just keep playing when you take them out luckily due to the hypersensitive touch panels i accidentally pause when taking them out most timesalso an odd design choice means that the power pads where the buds connect to the terminals in the case is just rear of the earplug this puts a ridged surface directly touching one of the folds of the ear  if you push the earpiece all the way in you are putting the one rough surface directly against your ear  sennheiser could have easily put this on say the rearfacing portion of the block and let smooth plastic touch the ear but well they didnt  youll get used to it but its just an unnecessary design choiceconnection is quick with verbal feedback in the buds  battery life is as expected and runs easily the  or so hours the case can give another   it takes longer than an airpod pro to recharge its worth charging over a longer break than just the few minutes other products can charge in  the case has a usbc plug but the included cable is tiny throw a normal length one in your cart when you buy this  the case has no wireless charging ability oh well  the case is larger than expected a little heavier than an airpods pro case and due to its rectangular shape and width a bit pocket unfriendly  the top does have a hingehelper which holds the top open something more cases should trysennheiser has an app for ios and android and it really is necessary  it allows a firmware update to  that substantially improved connection speed  you can customize almost all the tap patterns i added play pause to the right ear instead of just on the left  it also lets you store different eq profiles just  bands so a bit gross but better than nothing theres also a touch and slide interface but its really just a layer on the  band  the profiles are stored in the bud and can be changed live via the app even if you are listening to another source so using the phone to adjust the eq while listening to the computer  the app lets you control the connections as well like most bt devices you cant connect to more than  source hot at a time aka no multipoint and switching is still manual apples airpods ecosystem is more automatic and bose has done a nice job of having  sources mounted at once and having easy swapping between themthese are not sport buds they dont quite stay in all that well in my ears when moving and have  watersweat protection beyond the usual a bit will probably be fine but during a heavy workout these re not fully protected from salty sweatso other than odd choices in where to put the power connectors the large size of the main block the sensitivity of the touch panel and oddities of the eartips size the sound quality is amazing far better than i expected from a bluetooth connection esp for the price  master and dynamic has a similar pair that drop in price to around  and yamaha has a nice pair around this price with similar specs but after trying them all im willing to put up with the odd design choices for that clean sennheiser sound  "

than speakers i have studio monitor speakers to master the audio music sound effects and foley sounds in projects i will listen to the mixdown both on headphones and then the studio monitors afterwardsmy needs clear distortionfree full sounding headphones with no artificial noise cancellation or artificially boosted frequencies that capture the nuance of sound from the deep rumble of earth tremors to the whine of mechanical gears moving and still be able to throw on a playlist of drum  bass or chunky house music to groove to while creating landscapes previs concepts modelling or sculptingi read up on all sorts of headphones and iems checked on reviews consulted with friends with similar backgrounds surprisingly these iems came recommended by several connections and reviewers i had a hard time believing that a pair of  inear monitors could compete with my shure s that died and the pioneer djes that i used as a club djbefore i go into a review i will say that i purchased the linsoul tripowin core iem cable the same time i purchased these monitors and have not used the included core standard cable more on that laterpros price hands down this is the number one advantage to these iems i dont need to expand on that too much  cdn for this quality is ridiculous sound hzkhz frequency range is also ridiculous the added db of base from the previous model hz zero does punch up the bass in music some but not to the point of creating crackling distortion or sound fake when listening to spoken words vs music for creators the added depth hz from usual hz of frequency and low end warmth created by the db boost is magnificent whether authoring music for an animation creating layers of sound effects for atmosphere or mastering spoken words in video  the sound is clean neutral and true to what you will hear in playback unlike consumer brand bass heavy augmented headphones clarity as above very clean and truetolife sound reproduction whether used on pc mac smart phone or tablet these just sound good period after a total of  hours of testing i found no discernible ear fatigue comfort i spend a lot of time in front of a computer with headphones on comfort is   after sound quality i opened the box installed the cable and kept these inear for more than  hours without noticing any discomfort i can easily see myself doing a straight  hours or more without issue the units are light enough fit the ear very well are stable when turning from screentoscreen and typingdrawingmousing stars for comfort alone linsoul tripowin core replacement cable  truth be told i havent bothered to plug in the supplied core cable that came with the zero i bought the replacement cable at the same time as the iems for a reason more coresmore sound if you read this and choose to buy the hzcrinacle zero iems buy this cable dont think just add it to your cart and thank me later very well made easy to install and the sound  well core number counts for something theres a reason cpus are getting more cores and threads yearoveryearnow cons std cable supply the core cable standard and add  to the retail price people will still buy the replacements but cmon guys give the drivers the love they deservea cable length the tripowin cable is m and the included cable is marginally shorter these are fine lengths for hooking up to a remote transmission system for musicians  when working on a pc or mac desktop well its a bit short if im being honest maybe this is splitting hairs but if there was a way to have a m main cable and include a m extension that would be ideal for those of us tied to a desk rather than rippin a phat guitar solo no foam ear tips  this kinda hurt a bit i loathe silicon ear tips always have and always will yes shure and pioneer cost  times the price of the zero they also come standard with both silicon and comply tips im not saying linsoul needs to include comply however for me i know that heat sensitive foam tips create a better seal inear and therefore cancels out  of background noise allowing me to significantly lower the volume and saving my ear drums from the fatigue of daily sustained audio vibrations put foam tips in the package charge an extra  if you must your customers will thank you no case  i mean really this should just be a standard not an upgrade i cant think of a single reason a case is not an automatic addition to the purchase does anyone at linsoul have a cat at home include a case and save the rest of us from having to find kittys new toy after we make a sandwichoverall i give these  stars for the important things sound comfort price points were deducted for the important nicetohaves no foam tips core std cable no case the cons werent enough for me to reduce the initial joy of listening to these iems for

","s faulkner","verified purchase",2022-09-29,5,"        first of all im an audiophile and a technophileive spent  years in consumer electronics so id consider myself as someone who is approaching expert levelsecondly ive a headphone addiction i dont want to add up what ive spent on headphones this year or any year for that matteri own them all value brands under  midrange  and higher end sony bose sennheiser etci particularly like headphones that punch above their weight class in other words these  headphones can compete with their sony and bose competitors that sell for almost twice as much moneyi evaluate headphones using the following criteria ease of pairing fit and comfort how long can i comfortably wear these headphones accessories i like a good selection of different sized ear tips and wings to secure a good fit battery life and the size of the charging case packaging and unboxing a company that gives me a good experience opening the packaging usually means a quality device device build does it feel cheap or does it use quality materials sound quality most important i evaluate sound quality on the following factors bass response is it clear and tight is it boomy and muddy midrange response good midrange means better vocal sound quality treble response as males age we lose our ability to hear higher frequencies or midrange good treble allows the listener to hear cymbals clearlyall right lets goease of pairing you can do two things the first time you use these headphones they go into pairing mode using your devices bluetooth settings pair them up and they are ready to go or download the soundcore app from your respective app store and install it using the app it will detect your pro s and start the setup process after a quick firmware update i continued the setup the app has a hearid procedure that tests your hearing using different frequencies to see if you can hear them it then tunes the headphones to your individual hearing abilities for each ear you can also download an ldac codec if you use a hires streaming service like tidal qobuz or amazon music hd ive got them all apple music finally supports lossless audio but if youre using an ios device it doesnt support lossless audio even with their airpod pro model full disclosure i dont like apple products other than my ipad for facetime once you use the app and go through the setup thats where these models shine i was startled at how good they soundedfit and comfort ive been wearing these headphones for almost  hours and im not noticing any significant discomfort i suspect  hours will be my limit and ill have to take them out of my ears for a break as all of our ears are different your mileage may vary choosing the right tip and wing is vitalaccessories its an efficient setup with a good selection of tips and wings for most users the charging case is smaller than the previous model which is nicebattery life i always recommend charging before st use after  hours im still at  battery remaining with anc on they claim up to  hours with a full charge on the case depending on what level of anc you use and listening volume your mileage may vary i suspect that their claims are pretty accuratepackaging and unboxing efficiently excellent they come in a  by  square box it opens like a book with quick start guide on inside left the eartips and wings are in the spine of the packaging followed by the headphones in their charging case and a usb c nice charging cabledevice build excellent i was impressed with copper color of the speakers where you install the ear tips i bought the black model they have a nice matte finish with a greysilver casingsound quality finally overall they are excellent and they definitely punch above their weight class the bass response is tight with the tiniest bit of boominess or muddy sound i suspect a proper break in or changing the wings or eartips will solve reduce this the midrange and vocals are impressive to excellent vocals are very clear and maybe a tad bright the treble is excellent the highhat cymbal is damn near perfect the stereo imaging and soundstage is excellent you can place the instruments in the room the depth of sound is excellent as well you can hear the drummer behind the singer and guitar player to left and right i used tidal in hi res and used the headphones set up in ldac modei use three songs to evaluate my headphoneswicked as it seems from keith richards excellent main offender album  remaster keef records in analog and live in the studio it keeps the air in the music and doesnt reduce the imaging qualitybarbie dreams by nicki minaj i really am not a fan of rap or modern rb music i just listen it to evaluate bass response this track is where i noticed the slight boom in the bass these tracks are basically made and mixed in a computer no air in them if you like this type of music these headphones are satisfyingone by u mary bligeu duet this where the vocals and imaging shine you can hear the subtlety in the edges guitar playing the drums and bass are right where they need to be you can hear the scratchiness in bonos vocals and the sheer perfection of marys vocal rangeill probably move on to some fleetwood mac phil collins and the rolling stones for further evaluation i also like adele and imelda may i expect ill have the same experience as my  reference tracks  after i do some more varied listening ill adjust my ratings if necessarymy review is really  stars they are not quite a  but definitely deserve more than  starsif youre eying sony xm or bose soundsport or sennheiser equivalents but are struggling with spending  grab these liberty  pro headphones yes the sony and sennheiser will sound better but not twice as good as these pro models at half the priceif youre looking at dipping your toes in hires music and want a starting point you cant go wrong with these liberty  pro headphones i heartily recommend you use the soundcore app and take the time to do the firmware updates and do the hearid to match these headphones to your ears and hearing abilitiesif youve read this far what are you waiting for get a pair or two  "

i know how to put these things in i thought then i realised there are  parts to the way they sit in your earthe problem with in ear monitors is keeping the damn things in your ear so they work to their besthere they have designed them so the part that sits on the outer part of your ear has a silicone sleeve to help keep things in place then a second silicone sleeve is used for the bit that goes in your earthey come in  sizes small medium and large for both bitsyou could in theory have small and medium in  ear and both medium in the other earin practice i found the medium size to work perfectly for methey are comfortable with an excellent seal and i have not had them come loose in a few gym sessions since purchasealso there has been no sweating issues or that feeling of pressure in my earsso top marks for fit and sealnow before i get on to the sound i have to talk about the appthe soundcore app should be the benchmark for others to be measured against it is that goodso many features but you dont have to use themif you wish you can just pair them via bluetooth simple and pretty much instant after the first time and listen as you would normallybut if you do go into the app  and i strongly recommend you do  you have a range of optionsthere are a multitude of eq settings options on noise cancelling and a couple of new ones on meas things are new there will be regular updates that is not to say they it is unstable at all it has worked perfectly for mehearid is where a range of frequencies are played to your ears at a very low level   so you need to run this test in a very quiet environment  to identify how you hearonce complete it creates a custom eq setting for your hearingit actually works toothere is also the same test run for getting the best out of the anc active noise cancelling in that one you want to be in a noisy environment  i used the gymnow how do these things sound thenabsolutely fantastic to my ears anywaystrong bass and really clear mids and highs in short a wonderfully rounded sound that actually makes me smileit will show up lower quality recordings they simply wont sound as lively as a really good trackan example is chocolate by snow patrol on amazon music that sounds gorgeous with real depth and clarityswitch to street spirit by radiohead and it lacks the same level of depth  still sounds good thoughthe noise cancelling really surprised me i put them into my ears at the gym and before i had even put any music on the outside noise was almost turned offit does not block out everything but it was a huge differencei still have a pair of shure wired iems which were a lot more than these when i bought them a few years ago and i did a comparisonthe soundcores just sound betternow i have not tried these against the offerings from sony and bose but i would be amazed if they sound bettergripes minor onessome foam tips would have been a nice touch i love the comply tips for a perfect seal in the earplacing the iems in the charging case can be a little fiddly at first you have to get into the habit of putting them in a certain way which is counterintuitive to meand that is about itfor the price they are astonishing and should be given serious consideration before you spend a lot more on the above choicesi will update again in a couple of weeks once they have had some more useupdate so a couple of weeks in now and i continue to be amazed at how good these arei have used them extensively in the gym out running and just walking aroundthey have not fallen out or even felt like they were going to at any pointi fully charged them when i got them and the case still has  remaining with the earbuds at battery life is not a concerndid a firmware update last week and no problems at allnever had a single connection issue in all the time i have been using them which is probably in excess of  hours so far friends tried these at the weekend and were blown away by the sound quality one of them uses sonys xm headphones and the other airpods both are now waiting to see if these get reduced in the black friday sales later this monthoverall these are still hugely impressive and i really dont get the negative reviews citing poor connectionpoor fit and especially sound qualityi should also add i am not using the very latest phone with them either my personal phone is a galaxy s something over  years old nowif these were not good i would say it my bowers and wilkins pxs review is an examplethese are probably the best earbuds you can buy when you take into account cost battery life and sound quality

always goes bad in less than a year  the old s  i had lasted nearly  years  actually was my first amazon purchase in  and they failed sept   after heavy use  well i have been using these kss regularly on my walks and i do like them  i may pickup a set of headphones to use since i am in florida and after awhile like with any earbud my ears start to sweat and i rather use headphones when that happens i still have to say i am more impressed with these kss overall and i liked them beforei have a pair of now delisted ksns that were about  like these  just comparing the two these kbears sound so much better  i may give the kbear kss a shot because of my feelings for these but the ksns  they just sound off without heavy eqing and with these i just use my standard vshaped eq the ksns have an issue with the midmids to the highs where say guitars sound so far back and the vocals are way too forward  almost louder then the rest of the musicwith my older sony mp player with rockbox firmware i got those to sound good in one use case that player  these kbears just need my standard u  v shaped eq and they still sound better  and when i go after those ksns  those sony headphones i mentioned dont sound great either they need help so while i love my music i am no audiophile needing top notch gear  these sound good  maybe better than the sony headphones  the ksn iems that i have anyway just sound so much worse than theseto be fair  i am possibly considering picking up another pair of these with my bad luck with sony headphonesmid december update  i have to say that with a certain media player and a certain genre i listen to on that the ks zsns do not sound as off as some other players and genres with my usual u to a v shaped eq not a sharp v if it is a v  but these kss just sound so much better when those similiar earbuds just sound out of tune  like the different parts of the song vocals and music are pulled back andor pushed forward in odd ways  i am not going to say these kss will please a picky audiophile but  everything sounds balanced to me  listening to a number of genres just late last night trying my best to do an avsb comparision  the worst the kss were  caused me to go oh  this is well balanced but i wish it had a tiny more bump in the basesubbase i am totally fine with that  i love my samson sr headphones for instance but they have the same issue  great sound overall  well balanced everthing is where it should be  but on say some rap tracks  it could use a bit more bassi have no idea how kbear and ks relate to each other  from the same parent company  competitors  but when the ks zsns sounded off not terrible btw  just off to me  between the kss cable being just a little bit better in my view and the sound of course  it felt like the kss while i would not say they are junk  it felt like they were a knockoff model of these kbears  in the interest of fairness maybe if ks tuned them better they could sound exactly like theseif you are on the fence with earbuds like these  go with these kbear kssupdate without just copying and pasting parts of my reviews of a similar product in the same price range even a few  more  i have to say i am much more impressed with these over the kz zsn pros i got  with the same u to v shaped eq i have always used with my headphones and no tweaks to that these sound really good and impressed me right away  the kz zsn pros in the same price range are not tuned the way i like  i have to drop the top end highstreble to stop the piercing sound on those where you can even hear say cymbals from the drums over most everything else  or where the vocals are so forward they seem louder than the music  bass wise  i have to really bump up the eq base that was already a utov shape just to get a normal to me level of bass these kbear kss do not need any of that fiddling  do these sound perfect or audiophile level of course not  when eqed basically  do they sound as good as my sony mdrzxs that i love for walking around headphonesearbuds  yesi am so happy with the fact i ordered theseanother update i just got a pair of kz zsn pros that i bought for a similar price to what i got these for and as a comparison with the same eq settings i have always used and in my view even if a tad bass heavy at times  i dont dislike the kzs so far  but i may even consider returning them as they have parts of the mids  say vocals in alot of my tests just my own ears and how i think stuff sounds way too forward and they are lacking bass by default  the eartips on the kzs seem to be the exact same as these kss and doing a fast but admittingly short so far avsb comparsion i totally like the kss better  everything again a tad bass heavy at times is right where it should be with lows mids and highs  the kzs the model that some compare to the kss to me doesnt sound as good as these do but i admit i am still testing those ones out  with that ab test i mentioned  as soon as i put these kss in my ears with the same song same eq setting same player i noticed a difference right awayupdate after  days of using these outcomfort wise after my say  min to   hour walk during the dayearly evening   out of  stars from me and not counting kzs which i do not have yet but ordered due to a sale and how much i like these kbears  and a recommendation from youtuber dankpods as well i still say i am not an earbud guy but i do like these  forgetting the difference between iems  in ear monitors and earbudsi have to say though that the heat and humidity here in the far south of the usa has gone down a bit since the middle of the summer so that may effect how much id take the kbears out and just let my ear breath for a moment or two before putting them back in  this is to note that the comfort overall of the default eartips for my ears note everyones ear size is different so many different ear tips  which you can buy replacements for apparently and i love that is aok  there is part of me that doesnt like things stuck in my ears but that is not saying these are bad this is just my own personal preference  with the way they are made where the driver part sits outside your ear canal  you can push them in just a pitch if you feel them slipping out but for me i can never push them in too far which is a really good thingbased on what i just said i have to say that while the kbear kss have never come close to falling out or anything sometimes on some tracks while out on my walks i noticed the base lacking from what i heard earlier  i then slightly with almost no pressure pushed the kbears into my ears more and the base came back  with any iem or earbud that seels the ear canal the ear tip size vs the size of a persons ear can not only effect the comfort and passive noise cancelling but also the sound  too big for ones ears and an iemearbud can sound extra bassyone thing i noticed is that sometimes there was like an illusion of extra bass over different genres but that may just be me being a headphone guy not use to something stuck in my ears  when i listend to genres from rock to rap to smooth jazz too i closed my eyes just to really focus and i though is this too much bass or is that that i am hearing just due to my ear canals being sealed and these are balanced soundingonly long term use will tell me if the cable will be fine versus the bad luck i have had with earbuds where within a few weeks of careful use one side always stops working  this is one of the reasons other than sound quality i had a bad taste in my mouth for earbuds combined with my genrally good luck with my sony xz series onear headphonessound wise i have to say i am impressed at how balanced these are but my fear is to overstate how great these sound  i think these sound good and balanced but i am sure different similar iems that have  drivers per earbud in say the  or so  us prices anyway range will sound a bit betteri do not want to say these are the best sounding things ever omg but also if you have experience with earbuds a being so bass heavy the mids and highs are very week or b have had earbuds that  like many low end earbuds  are midsonly  these kss are not like that  if anything i think they are a bit bass heavy at times but that is with a key preference of the fact that the music player i am using at the time has my usual sony zx series headphone eq settings which does bump the bass up a bit  if i really tweaked that for not the sony headphones but these kss i could get it closer to what i like  in this case the extra bass is totally my own eq settings since i lowered that a bit and the extra bassiness i heard at times went down to where id like it  that is totally on memy settingsupdate summary after dankpods youtuber recommended these i picked them up and do not regret my choice  he also recommended different kz brand iems in the same range which i have ordered and on the way  i cant say which is better but unless these kss breakeven if the kzs ksn pros sound great  these are not going backi even just returned a pair of oneodio hifis that i was beyond disappointed with the sound and how muddy everything sounded despite they sound great reviews  i was hoping the kzs were not like that too before i got them and glad they are not only not bad  for in ear stuff again i have had a bad taste in my mouth for years with this type of earbud these are pretty darn goodoriginal reviewi have to note that this review is still based on first impressions to a degree though i have used two of my main music players and on each granted i did not change any eq settings setup for my usual sony mdrzxs or sony mdrzxs that i admit do not sound great at times but eqed right i think for walking around headphones that dont break the bank sound pretty goodi have to say that while years ago i use to use earbuds more  and had a favorite pair of earbuds in my late teen years not sure if there were tweaked models of this over the years but they are at least close to the sony mdrelp  or some variant if there were different models trying those as a new pair after my old ones broke on me the sound really  pushed me to be a headphonenot earbud guy  there was like all mids in the new pairs and the prior mention sonys became my regular headphones  i think he may have mentioned these but i know he mentioned a similar set of earbuds  youtuber dankpods and a good sale on these made me take the risk of trying these out  i have to say some video and amazon reviews do say that these sound more balanced but less v shaped eq wise then the kbear kss  i cant say i can compare the two of them to say which sounds betterpros   comfort  granted that most earbuds do not go over the back of the ear or at least none that i have had i was worried to a point wearing glasses and how these would feel  i can totally say that with my sunglasses or regular glasses this was a silly thing to worry about this is a total nonissue and there are no problems there  i mean i know there is a cord there but its almost as if there isnt with the way they feel so light  i do have to mention that eartip wise this is subjective and you may need to adjust the ones that fit right for you  i know that having the wrong tips on may even effect the sound quality to a point too  at the time i am typing this i have not even opened the little bag with the extra tips  the default medium tips feel great  personally i may want to take the headphones out and let my ears breath for a bit during long listening sessions though this is not an issue with the earbuds  or the tips  id do this with any earbuds i still am more of a headphone guy i also have had earbuds in the past not counting those sony es that really feel like they are going far into my ears and i dont like that  while providing a great seal for me  these default eartips do not feel like they are pushing in too far or becoming uncomfortable quickly  this all gets a two solid thumbs up from me on comfort   noise cancelling  ok  here is one i have seen people complain and give  out of  reviews on these for  with these there is no active noise cancelling and i think some people just see noise cancelling in the title of the listing and expect them to have say topend earbud active noise cancelling  now  i do admit that this goes with the get the right ear tips that fit you  comment  with the default tips there is without anything playing reasonable passive just from the seal of the eartips in the ear noise cancelling and at reasonable meaning you dont have to have music at full volume there is very good passive nc  i can barely hear my small black honeywell fan that is not quiet by any means right next to me during my testing  remember nothing is going to truely cancel out loud voices and some noises though i hear that different apple and especially sonys are great for that if nc is at the top of your list of wants  nc wise i give these a two thumbs up as well   sound quality  i cant say i have done tons of testing but i have not changing any of my eq settings from what i have them set to for my sony mdrs that i mentioned  have to note that testing these with my sansa fuze running rockbox and my victure m no matter what i do eq wise it never sounds as good as the sansa players i have i also have listened to some rap rock jazz and easy listening in my tests  i am not going to go over the top and say these are the best sounding note the eq commment but without touching my usual settings that bump up the bass and treble a tad  being a fan of a  say a combo of a u shaped eq and a vshaped eq  these kbear kss sound  really good  sometimes it can seem like some tracks have a touch too little bass but other tracks that make me go wow that bass is impressive for an earbud  everything i have listened to sounds clean too  between the bassmids and highs  nothing seems like its pushed too forward over the other  so many of the earbuds i have tried since and even the last pair of those i tried those sony s were what i used sound like they are trying too dang hard to prove they have alot of bass that the mids and highs at best  at best sound very muddy  i know all of these are in the budget range so i am not expecting perfect sound but when headphones do that sort of thing  i cant use them  the last pair of sony s i tried a few years back were all mids compared to earlier models and i had a pair that only had one side working they still sounded more balanced then the new pair i bought  even if id want to touch up the eq at times for these kbears slightly adjusting the bass or treble perhaps these sound clear in all three areas lows mids and highs and from what i have heard in my tests the vocals are not pushed back like even some headphones i have listened too  id say maybe the tuning is a slight ushaped tuning mixed with a flat tuning and i love that  it reminds me of a food dish where everyone can adjust or add sauces or whatnot to their taste on good foods versus a dish having too much of one thing or the other and you have to try to take something away  these are earbuds of course but  to a point considering that  they have a decent sound stage  i mean nothing huge forward and back like my samson srs but  a surprise to me for earbuds of any kind  that clean tuning has something to do with it too i think  putting everything together  its not like some earbuds that are i hear you like bass so here is all the bass even if it sacrifices the mids and highs  this sounds more like hey here is the music you want to listen to  we may add a touch more bass andor treble by default but not much  here is your music mostly asis unsure not cons but things to note maybe they will never be cons   i know all earbuds that are wired have small wires but these seem to be on that same track and versus the pictures the cord seems smaller than what i was expecting  thinner not length wise  i do love the fact that i can replace the cord what always goes eventually for me if the earbuds themselves are aoknote  putting the earbuds on the wire was really easy but take note that the writing of l and r are small and while i already have messed things up if you are careful its easy to take the buds off the wire  all you have to do once you know the l and r part of the wire and l and r earbud  pay attention to which way the earbud is facing on like me with one of them  you can goof up and put it on where the earbud faces outwards  if you are careful holding the tip of the wire where the prongs are and the earbud and dont just yank them apart  its no big deal to turn that around but i am always careful with smallthin wires myself  i am not sure how heavy duty this wire would be depending on the usecase but the fact that it can be replaced  was another thing besides the sound quality that drew me to taking a chance on thesei know i probably forgot something but i think that is all i wanted to say  as long as someone wantslikes earbuds and do not mind they are wired  id  recommend these  i cant of course say if these are better than the kss or any of the kz products i have seen youtuber dankpods mention but i have gotten some of those bad earbuds that sound awful to me and are made cheaply for around the same pricei know this is the gift giving time of the year and even if someone has some earbuds already id say this would be a great gift idea  they may even be surprised at the difference between their default earbuds that may have say come with a phone or other device versus the sound quality with these
